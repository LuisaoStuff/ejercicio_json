At one point he was active in Tangier, Morocco, where he romanced a woman named Francie. When this relationship soured, he traveled throughout Asia, and was hired in Japan by a crimelord, the Boss, to infiltrate a sumo-wrestling ring owned by a rival criminal, the [[Oyakata]]. Wilson spent three years as a wrestler under the Oyakata’s tutelage and became romantically involved with his mentor’s daughter, Sazae. When the Boss finally ordered the Oyakata’s murder, Wilson refused to complete his assignment, allegedly the first time he had ever done so, and relocated to the United States.\n\nIn America, Wilson met and fell in love with teenage prostitute [[Copycat|Vanessa Carlysle]], with whom he shared dreams of a better life. Wilson was subsequently hired by Middle Eastern interests to assassinate a blind British government operative named Althea, also known as Blind Al, but upon arrival at the Zaire base where she was stationed, he killed everyone except for Al who had fled. Wilson’s employers sought vengeance for his failure by targeting Vanessa, who was rescued by [[Culloden, Zoe|Zoe Culloden]], an employee of the interdimensional firm [[Landau, Luckman and Lake|Landau, Luckman, Lake, and LeQuare]]. Culloden was keeping Wilson under surveillance, believing he was destined to play a vital part in a potential threat to the world.\n\nLearning that he had contracted cancer, Wilson broke up with Vanessa rather than force her to remain with a terminally ill man. In Canada, he was offered hope in the form of [[Department K]], a special weapons development branch of the Canadian government. Wilson became a test subject in Department K’s branch of the joint U.S./Canadian superhuman enhancement project, the Weapon X Program; his cancer was temporarily arrested via the implantation of a healing factor derived from another Department K agent, the mutant adventurer [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]]. Wilson was active in a covert field unit alongside the near-invulnerable [[Sluggo]] and the cyborgs [[Kane]] and [[Slayback]]. Vanessa herself was later affiliated with the team after having manifested mutant shapeshifting abilities, calling herself Copycat.\n\nDuring one mission, Wilson killed his teammate Slayback. As a result, he was rejected from the Weapon X Program and sent to the Hospice, allegedly a government facility where failed superhuman operatives were treated. However, unknown to the Canadian government, the Hospice’s patients served as experimental subjects for [[Killebrew, Emrys|Doctor Killebrew]] and his sadistic assistant [[Ajax (Francis)|Ajax]], with the patients placing bets in a \"deadpool\" as to how long each subject would live. Killebrew subjected Wilson to various torturous experiments for his own deranged satisfaction. In due course, Wilson formed a semi-romantic relationship with the cosmic entity [[Death (embodiment)|Death]], who regarded him as a kindred spirit. Wilson’s emotional strength during his trials earned him the respect of his fellow Hospice patients. Then Ajax, angered by Wilson’s taunts, lobotomized one of Wilson’s friends. At Death’s prompting, Wilson killed his friend to end his suffering. However, under Killebrew’s rules any patient who killed another was to be executed; Ajax subsequently tore out Wilson’s heart and left him for dead, but Wilson’s thirst for vengeance was so strong that it jumpstarted his healing factor, regenerating his heart, although not curing his scarred body. Wilson then attacked Ajax, leaving him for dead in turn, and, taking the name Deadpool, escaped from the Hospice with his fellow patients.\n\nFollowing his escape, Deadpool served for a time as an enforcer alongside the surgically altered criminal [[Hammerhead]]. He soon returned to his freelance mercenary activities, donning a costume in keeping with his new identity. At some point during his mercenary career he was employed as an assassin by Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin of crime. He also clashed with Wolverine, at that time a spy for the Canadian government. Also, at some point during these years, Deadpool caught up with [[Blind Al]] and kept her a prisoner in his home. Al’s attempts to escape only resulted in death for those whose help she sought, leaving her no choice but to resign herself to captivity.\n\nSome years after escaping the Hospice, Deadpool, perhaps seeking compensation for the injuries inflicted upon him by Killebrew, returned to the Canadian government and was treated by Doctor Walter Langkowski, the bestial [[Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski)|Sasquatch]] of Canada’s super-team [[Alpha Flight]]. Deadpool soon found government work unsuited to his temperament, and he abandoned this endeavor. Hired by the criminal genius known as the [[Wizard]], Deadpool at first went to the wrong address and received a job impersonating the criminal Hobgoblin. When again contacted by the Wizard, he joined with fellow criminals the [[Taskmaster]] and the [[Constrictor]] in a short-lived version of the [[Frightful Four]]. When this plan also failed, Deadpool sought to reclaim his position as the Kingpin’s assassin, only to be challenged by fellow assassin [[Bullseye]]. Deadpool began frequenting the mercenary hangout called the Hellhouse, where the diminutive [[Patch (dispatcher)|Patch]] issued assignments. There he clashed with [[T-Ray]], a sorcerer and assassin to whom he took an immediate dislike. He subsequently found employment with the time-traveling arms merchant [[Genesis|Tolliver]], in whose service he was reunited with Sluggo and Copycat. Unbeknownst to Deadpool, Tolliver subsequently sent Copycat to impersonate another mutant mercenary, Domino. Deadpool also recruited a man named [[Weasel]] to act as his weapon supplier, and the two became fast friends.\n\nAfter some time in Tolliver’s service, Deadpool was sent to kill [[Cable]], the mutant soldier from the future who was in fact Tolliver’s father and in whose company Copycat was impersonating [[Domino (Neena Thurman)|Domino]]. However, Deadpool met defeat at the hands of Cable and his new charges, the young mutants in training known as the [[New Mutants]]. When Cable reorganized the New Mutants as [[X-Force]], Tolliver was seemingly slain in battle with them, setting off a search by his various mercenaries for the advanced technology he had left behind. Deadpool’s participation in the search was interrupted by the surprising interference of Slayback, who had cybernetically reconstituted himself after being slain by Deadpool and was eager for revenge. In the course of the ensuing battle, Copycat was gravely injured, and Deadpool sacrificed part of his healing ability to save her life.\n\nDeadpool subsequently helped X-Force member [[Siryn]] against the unstoppable [[Juggernaut]] and her uncle, [[Cassidy, Black Tom|Black Tom Cassidy]], who had forced Killebrew into their service. Deadpool developed a strong attachment to Siryn, who only partially returned his feelings. Unsure of his worthiness, Deadpool sought out Copycat, only to find she was now dating Kane. Deadpool fought both Kane and Wolverine, who had been sent to check on Kane by a mutual friend. Deadpool was subsequently abducted by information brokers seeking a cure for the Legacy Virus but was rescued by Wolverine and the mutant mercenary [[Agent Zero|Maverick]].\n\nSoon afterward, Deadpool was approached by Zoe Culloden of the rechristened Landau, Luckman, and Lake who believed he was destined to be the Mithras, one who would help usher in a golden age for Earth. Skeptical, Deadpool turned her away, only to be hit with a string of personal failures, including the alienation of Weasel and Blind Al. Hoping to turn over a new leaf, he found that killing was not so easily left behind when, at the behest of the ghosts of his former Weapon X inmates, he killed Ajax. He hoped to move forward by accepting Culloden’s offer, only to be dismayed when he learned that his destined role was to kill [[Tiamat]], a potential threat to the arriving “Messiah.” Deadpool instead killed the Messiah when he learned that it brought not true peace but mindless bliss instead.\n\n[[Image:deadpool.gif|left]]Having lost his optimism about bettering himself, Deadpool returned to his mercenary life. Troubled by recent events, he sought the counsel of deranged psychiatrist [[Doctor Bong]], who advised him to work out his difficulties in a fight with Wolverine. The fight indeed cleared Deadpool’s mind, but his psyche was dealt a stunning blow by the resurrection of Mercedes Wilson whom Deadpool still believed to be his wife. T-Ray revealed himself not only as the one responsible for her resurrection, but also as the true Wade Wilson. The revelation did not break Deadpool’s spirit as T-Ray had hoped, for the mercenary still harbored hopes of bettering himself. Swearing vengeance, T-Ray departed with Mercedes Wilson.\n\nLater, in the course of an assassination assignment against author [[Vess, Duncan|Duncan Vess]], Deadpool again clashed with Wolverine who had sensed something strange about Vess. The pair found themselves battling Vess’s vengeful kinsmen after the author was revealed to be a werewolf, and they parted on good terms. Weeks later, Deadpool sought medical treatment for Siryn, who had been injured in a mission with X-Force. Allying himself with the mysterious [[Watchtower (organization)|Watchtower]] group, Deadpool captured Wolverine in exchange for Siryn’s treatment. Siryn was cured, while Wolverine easily outfought his captors.\n\nSeeking a new place for himself, Deadpool briefly shared an apartment with fellow mercenaries [[Titania (Mary MacPherran)|Titania]] and the Constrictor. However, Titania proved to be Copycat in disguise, and the apartment was destroyed by the Wizard and the Taskmaster, both seeking revenge on Deadpool. He next established a secret warehouse headquarters and took on a young sidekick who called himself [[Kid Deadpool]], but the youth, also seeking vengeance for Deadpool’s part in his father’s death, blew up the warehouse.\n\nDeadpool was then tracked down by the feral mutant [[Sabretooth]] and invited to join the new Weapon X Program. Impressed by Weapon X’s upgrade of his healing factor, he agreed to join, but soon found the organization’s methods to be too bloody even for him. After the death of Copycat at the hands of Sabretooth, he confronted [[Colcord, Malcolm| the Director]], only to have his healing factor reversed to the point where he again lost physical cohesion and died. The lingering effects of Deadpool’s healing factor upgrade resurrected him, leaving him amnesiac. A chance encounter with Weasel restored his memory, and he discovered that four other individuals had laid claim to the Deadpool name. These impostors were aspects of his own personality given form by a device called the Gemini Star, wielded by his nemesis T-Ray who had been hired by the intergalactic villain [[Thanos]], himself enamored of [[Death (embodiment)|Death]] and jealous of Deadpool’s relationship with her. T-Ray intended to manifest and extinguish every aspect of Deadpool’s personality, leaving him an empty shell; however Deadpool damaged the Gemini Star, causing his personality fragments to be absorbed into T-Ray, rendering him comatose. The better to confuse his enemy, Deadpool mocked him by claiming to be the true Wade Wilson after all.\n\nFollowing an assignment against the [[Four Winds (Cartel)|Four Winds]] crime family, Deadpool gained great status as a mercenary and formed a company called DP, Inc., aided by business partner [[Brandenberg, Sandi|Sandi Brandenberg]]. His success was short-lived, however, when the [[Black Swan]], a fellow assassin who had actually slain the Four Winds himself, and sought vengeance for Deadpool’s wrongful claim. Both men were believed dead after an explosive confrontation in the Swan’s German castle, but the Swan used his telepathic powers to merge   the memories and skills of both himself and Deadpool and he merged their skills into the corpse of his underling [[Agent X (Nijo)|Nijo]]. Deadpool’s healing factor resurrected Nijo, who arose badly injured and amnesiac. Nijo found his way to Sandi’s apartment. Sandi believing Nijo to be Deadpool nursed him back to health. Having no knowledge of his past Nijo took the name of Alex Hayden, and joined Sandi and the Taskmaster in a new mercenary endeavor, [[Agency X]].\n\n[[image:CABDPL031-AConner.jpg|center]]\n\nThe Black Swan soon resurfaced, with Deadpool in tow, intending to restore all three men to their previous states. During the transfer, the Swan betrayed both Deadpool and Nijo, absorbing all of their abilities and achieving great power. With the help of his friends, Nijo broke through the Swan’s telepathic shield and defeated him, reversing the transfer. Deadpool declined an offer to join Agency X, returning to his solo career.\n\nDeadpool was then hired by the One World Church to steal the Façade Virus from Sunic Pharmacopeia in Germany. The Church sought to use the virus to transform everyone into blue-skinned beings like themselves, but their plans were foiled by Cable. Deadpool ultimately worked alongside Cable in this endeavor, but it seems certain that the two adventurers will again find themselves at odds.",

            "bio": "Born untold thousands or even millions of years ago in the dimension of the vastly powerful energy-entities called the Faltine, Dormammu and his sibling [[Umar]] gathered matter to themselves to increase their power, a practice anathema to their fellow Faltine. Ultimately slaying their parent Sinifer, they were driven from their home dimension and assumed human form to explore others. Their search for conquests brought them to the [[Dark Dimension]], a mystic realm riddled with natural warps into pocket universes within the dimension itself. At the time of their arrival, the Dark Dimension’s multi-species society had been at peace for almost 28,000 years and was in the third millennium of the rule of King Olnar.\n\n[[image:DormammuInline.jpg|right]]Despite the warnings of his sorcerer advisors the Mhuruuks, Olnar offered Dormammu and Umar sanctuary and power in exchange for the knowledge of how to shatter dimensional barriers and absorb other dimensions into his domain. After decades of such conquest, Dormammu, whether by chance or design, led Olnar to the dimension of the [[Mindless Ones]], indestructible rampaging dreadnoughts who slew Olnar and many other Dark Dimension denizens. Dormammu and Umar repelled and confined the creatures, using the confusion to murder most of the Mhuruuks, and were hailed as heroes by the Dark Dimension, of which they were proclaimed regents; Olnar’s infant son Orini, deemed no threat, was allowed to live under their care. As ruler, Dormammu partially reverted to flaming Faltine form and merged his essence with that of the Dark Dimension’s innate mystic energies, increasing his power enormously.\n\nLittle is known of Dormammu’s early rule, and since denizens of the Dark Dimension have millennia-long lifespans within a universe whose time passage may not match Earth’s anyway, it is almost impossible to guess how long those activities lasted. He warred with several extradimensional rulers and allied with others, forming a pact with [[Odin]] of [[Asgard]] and even joining the embodiment of [[Eternity]] to banish the occult juggernaut called [[Zom]] within a netherworldly amphora. He apparently observed the Earth dimension for several millennia, supposedly even manipulating the creation of the demon [[Satannish]] in Earth’s ancient pre-history; he often clashed with [[Agamotto]], the extradimensional entity who appointed himself that universe’s first Sorcerer Supreme, and his disciple, an unnamed tentacled alien. The immensely powerful amulet called the [[Eye of Agamotto]] was wielded against Dormammu, as was the mysterious Staff of One, but Dormammu rarely if ever met true defeat, and in time he ascended the ranks of those mystic beings whose patronage was beseeched by mortal sorcerers.\n\nWhen Umar went mad after bearing a daughter to Orini, now in millennia-old adulthood, Dormammu used trickery to banish her to a pocket universe, becoming sole ruler of the Dark Dimension and continuing his conquests. Orini became Dormammu’s most devoted disciple and raised his daughter [[Clea]] in the Dread One’s service. \n\nFinally, prompted by events that remain unrevealed, Dormammu targeted the Earth dimension for conquest in 1666, causing London’s Great Fire and using the life-force of its victims to link the two dimensions via Stonehenge. However, Dormammu suffered his first defeat when forced back to the Dark Dimension by the Mystic, Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme. In 1692, Dormammu also clashed with Salem exorcist Hiram Shaw, who vied for the Sorcerer Supreme title, and other earthly foes came and went over the centuries, but the Mystic, later called the [[Ancient One]], became his true obsession; indeed, the Ancient One’s influence spread throughout the multiverse, protecting other realms from Dormammu’s grasp. Unable to penetrate the mystic barriers erected by his foe to protect the Earth dimension, Dormammu occasionally acted through earthly pawns over the centuries, as when, in 1888, he was involved in creating [[Jack the Ripper]], perhaps in cooperation with mastermind Fu Manchu, via a mystic parasite later called the [[Zaniac]].\n\n[[image:DormammuInline3.jpg|left]]In 1943, Dormammu accepted [[Baron Mordo]], disciple of the Ancient One, into his service via the sacrifice of Mordo’s own mother and grandfather; a year later, the Eye of Agamotto was stolen, whether through Mordo’s betrayal or not, by Nazi operatives and given to the [[Red Skull (Johann Shmidt)|Red Skull]], who inadvertently traveled to the Dark Dimension via its power. When [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] and [[Winter Soldier|Bucky (James Barnes)]] wrestled the amulet from the Skull, the villain bargained with Dormammu for power in exchange for its retrieval, but the Ancient One sent [[Fury, Nick|Sgt. Fury]] and the [[Howling Commandos]] to aid Captain America and Bucky, and Dormammu contemptuously dismissed the Skull from his sight; ironically, Jack the Ripper was one of several time-displaced criminals led against Captain America and Bucky by the sorcerer Terdu later that year. Eventually, Mordo, with Dormammu’s patronage, slowly weakened the Ancient One’s power, a plan eventually halted in 1963 by [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Steven Strange]], who became the Ancient One’s true disciple and ultimate successor; however, Mordo continued to provide Dormammu with human sacrifices.\n\nIn recent years, Mordo, evidently displeased with his progress as Dormammu’s servant, sought sacrifices for a mysterious entity, the Great Enigma. His efforts won the attention of Doctor Strange and the heroic [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], and Mordo fled through a portal, only to arrive before the Enigma, none other than Dormammu himself, who had perhaps used the alias to test his hapless catspaw. But Strange’s opposition intrigued Dormammu, who wondered if the Ancient One’s power was at last faltering if only his successor stood against Mordo. \n\nShortly afterward, Dormammu sent a ghostly messenger to the Ancient One to announce a renewed intention to conquer the Earth dimension. When Strange traveled to the Dark Dimension in response, Dormammu, surprised that even this challenge did not rouse the Ancient One to action, sent supernatural servitors to bedevil the newcomer. When Strange bested all comers, Dormammu met him in mystic combat, but Strange proved more powerful than anticipated. As he drew upon the Dark Dimension’s energies, Dormammu inadvertently weakened the barrier containing the Mindless Ones and withdrew to force them back. Not wishing Dormammu’s subjects to suffer, Strange lent his mystic might to Dormammu, successfully re-sealing the juggernauts. Indebted to Strange for his help, Dormammu felt compelled to end the fight, and Strange made him vow never to threaten the Earth dimension again. Enraged by this turn, Dormammu swore vengeance against Strange, a grudge which even outweighed his hatred of the Ancient One.\n\nDormammu soon found a loophole to his vow by granting Mordo more power than ever before, for Strange’s murder by a third party would negate the pact. Mordo and his minions hounded Strange across the world for weeks until finally abducting the Ancient One as a bargaining chip to lure Strange to the Dark Dimension. But Mordo’s boasting wearied Dormammu, who brought all three Earth sorcerers with him\nto a neutral realm where, in his own fit of bravado, he summoned the Lords of the Netherworlds, his peers in dimensional domination, to watch him overcome Strange in hand-to-hand combat. However, when Strange seemed to gain the upper hand, Mordo struck him a mystic blow from behind, outraging Dormammu’s sense of honor. Banishing Mordo for his troubles, Dormammu faced Strange in a rematch, but fell to his foe’s greater familiarity with physical combat. Before the gathered Lords, Strange forced Dormammu’s vow to menace Earth no further even by proxy, cementing the Dread One’s humiliation. However, Dormammu struck a parting blow by extradimensionally banishing Clea, and then manipulating fellow Nether-Lord Tazza into attacking the sorcerer.\n\nDriven to mad fury by their grudge, Dormammu, for reasons unclear, dared to challenge the almighty Eternity himself. Even Dormammu’s power was\nno match for the universal embodiment, who dismissed his foe to the mysterious Realm Unknown, the very dimension where, ironically, Clea now languished. Rallying the demonic Dykkors, banished there by the Ancient One long ago, Dormammu sent wraithlike beings to drain power from the searching Strange, whom he imprisoned. Clea, however, escaped to Earth and mystically influenced Umar, ruling the Dark Dimension in her brother’s absence, to free Strange. The sorcerer confronted his nemesis at the very gateway to Earth he meant to enter, only for Dormammu to be paralyzed by the force of his own vow to leave Earth untouched.\n\nMonths later, having reclaimed the Dark Dimension, Dormammu sought a new loophole by possessing the earthborn Strange himself, but met defeat at the hands of Strange and his new allies, the [[Defenders]]. Thinking to make Strange’s own friends his catspaws, he then allied with the Asgardian god [[Loki]], Odin’s foster son, to manipulate the Defenders into obtaining the talisman called the [[Evil Eye]], whose power he hoped to use to merge the Earth dimension and his own. However, Loki was uninterested in sharing power and manipulated the [[Avengers]] into also seeking the Eye, sparking the so-called [[Avengers/Defenders War]]. When the two teams discovered the plot, they confronted both menaces and, at the prodding of the mutant [[Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff)|Scarlet Witch]], the Evil Eye absorbed Dormammu as energy and redirected it at Loki, driving the god from the scene. But a spark of Dormammu’s consciousness remained, and with Umar’s help, he was reborn on Earth itself. Having thus cheated his vow, and doubtless buoyed by the Ancient One’s recent death in battle with the monstrous demon [[Shuma-Gorath]], Dormammu was nonetheless betrayed by Umar and banished by Strange, now Sorcerer Supreme, and the earth-spirit [[Gaea]]. A subsequent gambit, pitting Strange against the demonic [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] and the ghostly Bounty Hunter, met no better success.\n\nAs a new tack, Dormammu allied with [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]] to channel the power of the mysterious mystic confluence called the Bend Sinister, with Doom’s pawn Lucius Dilby attempting to use Strange as a human sacrifice. However, Spider-Man disrupted the ritual, freeing Strange but leaving Dormammu no worse off than before. Perhaps reminded of Mordo’s defeat years earlier by Strange and Spider-Man, after ritually maintaining universal balance in a chess match with Odin, Dormammu subtly directed Mordo to time-travel to 1943, where Mordo’s grandfather Viscount Krowler, his death still months away, absorbed that era’s the power of that era’s Mordo. Krowler’s Dark Cabal then prepared to grant Dormammu access to Earth by channeling the terror and hatred provoked by Nazi bombings of England. Fortunately, Strange followed Mordo into the past and won the help of Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos; Dormammu was given little time to jog his memory regarding the Commandos when Strange and Fury disrupted the ceremony, scattering Dormammu’s mystic essence throughout time and space.\n\n[[image:DormammuInline4.jpg|right]]Months later, Strange, following his own arduous confrontation with Shuma-Gorath, healed himself via processes that took him through various dimensions; unknown to Strange, a portion of the incorporeal Dormammu attached himself to his foe during one such passage and, when Strange returned to Earth, possessed the sorcerer’s body as he had first planned years before. Possession of a human body exempted Dormammu from his vow, and he summoned extraterrestrial sorcerers, including Agamotto’s now-renegade tentacled disciple, as his lieutenants. Dormammu vowed to oust the unfathomable [[Celestials]] themselves as the greatest power in the Earth dimension, but Strange, his consciousness having fled into a rat, lured Dormammu into blasting him with mystic power, enabling him to rebuild his astral form while his ally [[Topaz]] exorcized Dormammu’s presence.\n\nUndaunted, Dormammu returned to the Dark Dimension, luring Strange by unleashing the Mindless Ones upon Earth, then trapping him in helpless symbiosis with Clea. Perhaps in nostalgia, he invited Umar to share his reign once more, then banished her anew when she predictably turned against him. Dormammu’s invasion of the Earth dimension met unlikely resistance from Baron Mordo, at last weary of\nDormammu’s abuses and hoping to claim Earth for himself. As Strange and Clea freed themselves, Umar, with Mordo as her champion, forced Dormammu into a compromise, promising him his own dimension to begin anew but neglecting to mention it was that of the Mindless Ones, who were as eager to assault Dormammu in their domain as they had been in his. Umar claimed rulership of the Dark Dimension, with Mordo as consort, but soon Dormammu, in the guise of the Faltine\nFlyx, lured Clea into gathering mystic allies among the Lords of the Netherworlds to depose her mother. This freed Dormammu to reclaim his realm, becoming more powerful than ever before. Strange, although greatly weakened after losing much of his own power by renouncing the Principalities who patroned him, confronted him alongside a new team of [[Secret Defenders]]. Giddy with power, Dormammu gloated that humanity’s own evil nature, demonstrated by the horrors of the very\nwartime era in which he had fought Strange and Fury, proved its need for his rule, then contemptuously dismissed his enemies and, soon afterward, allowed Strange and the human-alien hybrid [[Darkhawk]] to seal a breach between the Dark Dimension and Earth’s technological Cyberspace, indulgences he doubtless regretted later.\n\nWhen the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], heroic adventurers from the 31st century of [[Earth-691]], traveled to the modern era of Strange’s Earth-616, Dormammu, on a whim, followed them back to their home era and attacked their Drydock headquarters, demanding the presence of Doctor Strange, himself known as the Ancient One in the Guardians’ era. The future Strange and his disciple, the alien Krugarr, rose to the challenge, but neither Krugarr, the Guardians, nor their associates the Galactic Guardians could prevent Dormammu combining his own power with that of his future counterpart, from slaying Strange at last. However, careless from his victory, Dormammu allowed himself to be overwhelmed when the Guardians unpredictably teleported him throughout their ship and attacked him in succession with non-mystic powers unfamiliar to him, forcing him to return to his home time and realm.\n\n[[image:DormammuInline2.jpg|left]]Whether as a result of his travels through time or of the reality-altering War of the Seven Spheres, Dormammu, despite victory over not one Doctor Strange but two, suffered severe power loss, reducing him to a humanoid husk while Clea led a rebellion against him. Retaining his throne but slow to recover his power, Dormammu bound his essence to a minor demon, Underchild, to enter the Earth dimension unnoticed, where he manipulated the mutant Jonathan White into granting mystic power to others, strengthening his master via millions of worshippers. Although Doctor Strange soon ended this gambit, the revitalized\nDormammu launched his most ambitious scheme yet in a war against the demons and death-gods that governed Hell itself, through which he planned to reach Earth. With [[Satannish]] as his lieutenant, he captured two-fifths of his targeted regions but was driven out by the united power of his adversaries, rallied by the heroine Hellcat. Dormammu’s own realm suffered attack by the vastly powerful Archenemy, whom even the Mindless Ones could not overwhelm, forcing his own alliance with [[Mephisto]] and dozens of other demonic rulers of the so-called Splinter Realms before the creature was finally destroyed by the sorceress [[Magik (Amanda Sefton)]], but not without severe damage to all realms involved.\n\nPerhaps hoping to recoup his losses, Dormammu attacked the Earth dimension once more. Strange again scattered Dormammu’s essence throughout the dimensions, but Dormammu, anticipating this ploy, released the Mindless Ones on Earth; when [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] used his technology to force the Mindless Ones back, he inadvertently drew Dormammu back to Earth. Strange nevertheless defeated him, daring to tamper with time itself to ensure victory, but Dormammu resurfaced months later, driven to irrationality and speaking of a childhood and parents he had never had. Umar humored him while, via a shift in the Cosmic Axis, the pair’s power increased to such an extent that they were able to overwhelm Eternity entirely. Immersed in Eternity’s essence, Dormammu re-made the Earth into his own hellish domain, with a Doctor Strange doppelganger as his lackey; his endeavors were opposed by the true Doctor Strange and the Defenders, but ultimately it was Umar, having taken a liking to the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]], who thwarted him, claiming his power for her own and restoring Earth. Dormammu was apparently reduced to a ranting human, but there is little doubt he will return.",

            "bio": "<br>\n\n=== Tragedy Among the Gypsies ===\nVictor von Doom was born to the [[Zefiro]] travelers (Gypsies) [[von Doom, Werner|Werner]] and [[von Doom, Cynthia|Cynthia]] in [[Latveria]], a small European country which grew out of Hungary and was ruled by King [[Fortunov, Vladimir Vassily Gonereo Tristian Mangegi|Vladimir Vassily Gonereo Tristian Mangegi Fortunov]], Baron of Sabbat, Baron of Haasen, Baron of Krozi. Victor barely knew his mother, a witch who had invoked the demon [[Mephisto]] for power, which raged out of control before she was finally slain by a soldier. Before dying, she asked Werner to protect young Victor from Mephisto. Victor's father, a doctor, was forced to treat King Vladimir's wife. When Werner could not cure her cancer, Vladimir blamed him for his wife's death, and Werner fled with Victor. Werner died from exposure to the cold while protecting his son. Before dying, Werner placed Victor into the care of his best friend, [[Boris]], and tried to warn his son of the fearful life he foresaw him falling into, but he died before he could make Victor understand.\n\n=== A Chosen Path ===\nDiscovering his mother's mystical artifacts, Victor schooled himself in sorcery. He began an annual contest against the might of Mephisto, attempting to set his mother's soul free. By the time he was a teenager, he had also become a scientific genius and used his inventions to wage a one-man war against the monarchy of Latveria, always a step ahead of them. His genius was heard of even in America, and he was invited to New York's [[Empire State University]] on a scholarship. Victor had been in love with Boris' granddaughter [[Valeria]], but he left her behind as his desire to acquire knowledge and the means to seek revenge on others consumed him. \n\n=== Disgraced, Scarred, and Doomed ===\nArriving at State, Doom was greeted by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], a fellow student who was interested in rooming with him, but Doom rejected his offer of friendship. Throughout his university days, Doom pursued a rivalry with Richards, convinced of his own superior intellect. Doom's greatest invention was a machine designed to rescue his mother's soul from the netherworld. Richards tried to warn him of a flaw in his calculations, but Doom was too proud to listen. He activated the machine and it exploded in his face. Expelled for the explosion, Doom sustained only a few facial scars, but believed his looks had been ruined. Filled with self-loathing he left America for Tibet, seeking new enlightenment. There he found the [[Aged Genghis]], one of the enigmatic [[Immortal Nine]]. The now senile sorcerer directed him to seek out a long-lost order of monks. Doom made them his servants and had them forge his first suit of armor, designed to hide his features from the world. Doom had them press the mask to his face before it had cooled, ensuring that if his face had not been hideous before, it was now.\n\n=== The New Ruler of Latveria - For Life ===\nDr. Doom then conquered Latveria, slaying King Vladimir, imprisoning his son [[Fortunov, Rudolfo|Rudolfo]], and having a robot duplicate of Rudolfo surrender the Latverian crown to him, after which he renamed the capital city, Haasenstadt, as Doomstadt. He used his genius and technology to transform Latveria into a paradise where no citizen wants, no one is threatened by war, and all praise Doom-- or face the consequences. While Doom maintained a puppet prime minister, the outside world was largely unaware of Doom's status as ruler, tending to dismiss his existence as a myth. Doom stepped up his scientific prowess, designing a time machine and robotic duplicates of himself: his [[Doombots]]. In one of his earliest time travels he journeyed back to World War II and considered killing [[Hitler, Adolf|Adolf Hitler]] for the crimes his [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] regime had inflicted upon the Zefiro and other travelers, but ultimately decided to leave him to his own fate. \n\n=== Goals Set Down ===\nArmed with his genius and the might of Latveria, Victor set for himself three goals: to rescue his mother, to prove his superiority over Reed Richards, and to conquer the world. By this time, Reed and his friends had become the [[Fantastic Four]], so Dr. Doom sought them out and abducted the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]]. He forced the other members to journey back in time to recover the gems of the legendary sorcerer [[Merlin]] for him; but Mr. Fantastic tricked him, bringing back a chest full of chains instead. Although the FF survived Doom's attacks, Doom escaped them by using a Doombot as a decoy. Dr. Doom next formed an alliance with the [[Sub-Mariner]], believing that their mutual hatred of the FF made for a natural partnership. Doom nearly cast the [[Baxter Building]] into the sun, but the Sub-Mariner turned on him and Doom was cast adrift into space. He was saved by the alien [[Ovoid]]s who taught him how to exchange bodies with others. With this new power, he had Marvel Comics creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby lure Mr. Fantastic into a trap so that he could take over his body. However, the Fantastic Four saw through Doom's facade and he was forced back into his own body, then accidentally cast into the [[microverse]].\n\n=== Through Time and Space ===\nBut the microverse proved to be merely a new challenge for Dr. Doom's genius rather than a prison. Doom conquered [[Mirwood]], the kingdom of [[Pearla|Princess Pearla]], and brought the Fantastic Four there as prisoners. Aided by [[Wasp (Hank Pym)|Ant-Man]] (Hank Pym), the Fantastic Four escaped and followed Doom back to [[Earth]], where they battled him aboard his [[Flying Fortress]], from which he threatened to unleash chaos throughout the globe--when the FF thwarted his plan, he escaped again. Doom soon attempted to reclaim his abandoned Flying Fortress from military custody, but the newly-formed [[Avengers]] intervened and he was forced to destroy it. Dr. Doom next empowered and sent the [[Terrible Trio]] ([[Brogin, Bull|Bull Brogin]], [[Dakor, Yogi|Yogi Dakor]], and [[Phillips, Harry|Harry Phillips]]) against the Fantastic Four, but this plot also failed and ended with Doom cast into space by a Solar Wave, a fate he had meant for the FF. He was rescued by the time traveler [[Kang|Rama-Tut]], who was so impressed with Doom that upon his return to his own time, he created for himself the masked identity of Kang the Conqueror. Rama-Tut had suggested to Doom at the time that they might actually be the same person, though this eventually proved false. \n\n=== A Crushing Defeat ===\nDr. Doom next engaged Reed in a mental battle at the Latverian Embassy to determine who had the greater intellect. They employed an encephalo-gun which would cast the loser into [[Limbo]], and Doom seemed to win the contest; but Reed had actually hypnotized Doom into believing Reed was cast into Limbo. When Doom was freed from the mesmerism by a Latverian hypnotist, he again targeted the Fantastic Four, who had temporarily lost their powers. But Doom was humiliated in the ensuing battle when the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]] regained his powers and angrily crushed Doom's hands inside his gauntlets then allowed him to slink away, furious that he had been forced to become the Thing in order to stop Doom. Doom, in turn, never forgot what the Thing had done.\n\n=== The Machinations of Doom ===\nWhen Reed Richards was wed to Sue Storm, a spiteful Doom used an [[Emotion Charger]] to send scores of super-villains to the wedding site, but they were defeated by the FF and their super-heroic wedding guests. Reed ultimately undid the assault with a sub-atronic time displacer which sent all of the villains back to before Doom summoned them with no memory of what had occurred. Reed and Sue's wedding took place without further incident. Doom engaged in new schemes, once stealing the [[Silver Surfer]]'s powers, which he lost by challenging the barrier [[Galactus]] had placed around the Earth. He also swapped bodies with [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]], but this farce was foiled by the FF. Doom's obsession with the FF once nearly led him to sacrifice an entire Latverian village to kill them. Doom has also played deadly games with his robot, the [[Prime Mover]], games which have manipulated [[Fury, Nick|Nick Fury]] and [[Shang-Chi]] into battling robot duplicates of enemies such as the [[Yellow Claw]] and [[Razor-Fist (William Young)|Razor-Fist]]. \n\n[[Diablo (Esteban De Ablo)|Diablo]] once tried to force Doom into a partnership by holding his long-lost love Valeria hostage, but Doom used his time machine to cast Diablo into the future. He saved Valeria, but then lost her again--Valeria was ashamed of Doom's gloating over Diablo's fate. Doom's throne was threatened by its rightful heir, Prince Rudolfo, who was assisted by the extraterrestrial [[Faceless One]]. Doom also had to contend with his rogue creation the [[Andro|Doomsman]], and with the [[Red Skull (Johann Shmidt)|Red Skull]], who attempted to claim Latveria for himself. The [[Black Panther (T'Challa)|Black Panther]], ruler of [[Wakanda]], foiled Doom's attempt to steal Wakanda's [[Vibranium]], but Doom intended to make an ally of T'Challa one day. Doom also accumulated various power objects, culminating in his using the [[Cosmic Cube]] to usurp Galactus' power, but Reed stole the Cube, reversed its effects, and erased the events from everyone's memory. Doom also fought side-by-side with the FF to save the Earth from the [[Overmind]], acknowledging that while he had no love for them, he would not allow anyone to threaten Latveria. \n\n=== A History of Ugly Partnerships ===\nWhen the Faceless One sponsored another Latverian revolt, Doom hired [[Cage, Luke|Luke Cage]] to spy on them in the United States; however, he then refused to pay Cage for his services, so Cage tracked Doom down in Latveria and fought him to a standstill until Doom finally agreed to pay Cage what he was due. After rejecting Doom's offer of a new alliance, Namor reluctantly sought Doom's aid when the people of [[Atlantis]] were rendered comatose and Mr. Fantastic could not revive them. Namor aided Doom against Andro, formerly the Doomsman, who had brought many of Doom's robots under his control through a self-created religion; Doom in turn aided Namor against his enemies [[Dorcas, Lemuel|Dr Dorcas]], [[Tiger Shark]], [[Krang]], and [[Attuma]]. Still, Namor could not bring himself to fully trust Doom, so Doom ruined the water rebreather suit Namor needed to survive at that time and threatened to destroy Atlantis unless Namor pledged his allegiance to him. Namor was forced to comply. \n\n=== A War With the Master of Magnetism ===\nLearning of Namor's fate, the FF came to Latveria to aid him, only to discover that the United States had signed a non-aggression pact with Latveria, forcing them to depart. Surviving an assassination attempt by the vigilante [[Shroud]], Doom subsequently mind-controlled the Avengers into fighting Attuma for him. Finally, after receiving Namor's aid against the Red Skull, who had slain Rudolfo and briefly usurped control of Latveria, Doom made good on his bargain, restoring the [[Atlanteans]] to consciousness; Namor then ended their partnership. Following this, Doom spread a neuro-gas into Earth's atmosphere to bind the entire world's population to his will. His authority was challenged by the mutant [[Magneto (Max Eisenhardt)|Magneto]], and they fought, manipulating the [[Champions (of Los Angeles)|Champions]], [[Avengers]] and [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] into fighting for their sides. When Doom was attacked by the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], his mask overheated and he was forced to remove it, inhaling his own neuro-gas; this rendered him unable to control anyone affected by the gas. Via power gained from the [[Negative Zone]], Doom accessed the netherworld, only to be overwhelmed by spirits posing as his parents.\n\n=== Disastrous Fallout ===\nRealizing that his villainous actions had injured Latveria's reputation, Doom planned to abdicate the throne to his \"son\", actually a clone of himself named Victor von Doom II; but his son's true origins were exposed, and Doom was forced to slay the clone when it turned against him. However, this plot had merely been a ruse for Doom to take mental control of the United Nations using his Solartron Complex. After he was exposed to multiple images of his own face projected by the Solartron, Doom went completely insane and was imprisoned. Prince [[Fortunov, Zorba|Zorba]], Rudolfo's younger brother, reclaimed his family's throne from Doom, but Doom was freed by Boris and regained his sanity.\n\n=== An Heir to the Throne ===\nAided by the [[Puppet Master]], Doom had the Fantastic Four's minds placed into miniature synthetic bodies, living a mostly-idyllic life in the miniature town of \"Liddleville\" within his [[Adirondack Castle]]. Doom hoped this would prevent the FF from interfering with his attempts to regain the throne, but the FF managed to turn the tables on him and he wound up imprisoned within a synthetic body in Liddleville. The Puppet Master, furious at how his stepdaughter [[Masters, Alicia|Alicia]] had been treated by Doom's world, led an army against him there. Doom sought aid from the alien [[Microns]] when they passed through, but was finally rescued when his Doombots activated a contingency plan to return his consciousness to his own body. Learning that Latveria had fallen into anarchy without him, Doom convinced the Fantastic Four to assist him in overthrowing the now-insane Zorba and retaking his throne. Doom himself slew Zorba. In the aftermath, a young Latverian boy named [[Doctor Doom (Kristoff Vernard)|Kristoff Vernard]] was orphaned by Zorba's forces and Doom took the child under his protection, making him his heir. Another man, [[Flynn, Alexander|Alexander Flynn]], claimed to be Doom's true son, but that was later shown to be a falsehood created by the mutant telepath [[Shadow King]]. \n\n=== New Power, Gained and Lost ===\n[[image: doom01.jpg|left|205px|thumb]]Unleashing [[Terrax]] against the Fantastic Four, Doom was disintegrated when Terrax exploded in a blast of cosmic energy. Using the Ovoid technique, Doom transferred his mind into the body of an onlooker, [[McArthur, Norman|Norman McArthur]], an instant before his death. He eventually regained his original body from the [[Maker|Beyonder]], who sent him back a short distance in time to participate in the \"[[Secret Wars]]\" on his artificially created [[Battleworld]]. There Doom briefly usurped the immense power of not only Galactus, but the Beyonder himself, though he eventually lost all of his stolen power. Back on Earth, Doom once more achieved world domination, using the [[Purple Man]]'s mind control powers to subjugate the global population. Although Doom was able to solve most of the world's problems by using his work in Latveria as a model, he found the mindless obedience of humanity unsatisfying, and ultimately allowed the Purple Man to slip from his grasp during a conflict with the Avengers and Namor. \n\n=== The Rise and Fall of Kristoff Vernard ===\nAfter Terrax seemingly killed Doom, his Doombots had activated a contingency plan whereby Doom's past experiences were implanted within Kristoff's mind so that he could assume Doom's role. Kristoff went mad, believing he was Doom trapped in the body of a child. While Kristoff ruled Latveria, one of the Doombots, believing itself to be the true Doom, made a weak attempt to overthrow him. Finally, the true Dr. Doom returned to Latveria following a time travel adventure, and he retook the throne from Kristoff. Soon after this he helped cure [[Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura)|Ms. Marvel]] (Sharon Ventura), a new member of the FF who had become a grotesque \"She-Thing\". Doom used her to spy on the FF, but she eventually gave in to her conscience and turned against him. He transformed her into an even more grotesque creature as punishment.\n\n=== Doom Defeated? Never! ===\nDoom often attributes his many defeats to his Doombots; perhaps the most humiliating case is when [[Squirrel Girl]] defeated a Doombot by sending her squirrels to chew apart the wiring in its armor. Another Doombot participated in the \"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\" teaming up with the other prime movers--who were unknowingly pawns of the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] trickster-god [[Loki]]--against new foes. Other Doombots, such as [[Mechadoom]], have even turned against Doom and pursued their own goals, though such betrayal rarely long survives Doom's discovery. Doom has seen to it that Latveria's history is constantly revised to suit his needs, employing the mysterious [[Editor]] to affect all such changes. Doom tends to blame failures on underlings--such as [[Hauptmann, Gustav|Gustav]] and [[Hauptmann, Gert|Gert Hauptmann]]--who seldom live to fail again. Doom claims to have a contingency plan for every situation, and regards the FF's victories over him as mere setbacks. Doom's greatest victory came when, after years of combating Mephisto, he and [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Dr. Strange]] finally rescued the soul of Cynthia von Doom from Hell, allowing her to pass on to a better afterlife.\n\n=== The Death of Doom ===\n[[image: reed04.jpg|left|205px|thumb]]After briefly usurping the cosmic energies of [[Aron the Watcher]], Doom was severely wounded while seeking the power of the alien [[Hunger (alien)|Hunger]]. Doom attempted to take Reed with him and the pair were seemingly disintegrated in a powerful energy blast; however, the immensely powerful [[Hyperstorm]] had teleported them away. Long believed dead, Doom was freed from his extra-dimensional prison by the Fantastic Four and Kristoff, and aided them against Hyperstorm. Returning to Earth, Doom seemingly died yet again, this time alongside Earth's heroes battling [[Onslaught (entity)|Onslaught]]; but Doom and the others were preserved in the new [[Counter-Earth (Franklin Richards)|Counter-Earth]], created by [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin Richards]], and Doom lived out a new life in which he was an old friend of Bruce Banner, Reed Richards and [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Tony Stark]], who had all been members of a fraternity called \"[[Knights of the Atomic Table]]\".\n\n=== Conquering All Reality ===\nBut history repeated itself, and Doom became a villain on this Earth as well. When the heroes regained their memories, Doom helped them return to their own Earth via the [[Negative Zone]], but when he attempted to abscond with Franklin, Doom was assaulted by [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]] and cast back to Counter-Earth. With no super heroes to oppose him, Doom soon became ruler of Counter-Earth. He recruited [[Divinity (Counter-Earth)|Divinity]], [[Dorma (Counter-Earth)|Dorma]], [[Lancer]], [[Shakti]] and [[Technarx]] as lieutenants, and won a decisive victory over the powerful [[Tiamut|Dreaming Celestial]], which had attempted to claim Counter-Earth for itself. For a while, Doom ruled both Counter-Earth and Latveria simultaneously by projecting holograms back to Earth, but he ultimately found that Counter-Earth could never equal the utopia of his Latveria, so he returned to Earth to resume his duties in Latveria, leaving Lancer to rule Counter-Earth in his stead. Doom has also shown an infatuation with the [[X-Men]]'s [[Storm]] (Ororo Munroe). Via the powers of a defective Cosmic Cube, Doom once merged two realities, creating one in which he ruled Earth as emperor, with Storm as his queen. Like all of such efforts to achieve supreme power, however, the power was eventually usurped from him, and normal reality restored.\n\n=== The Road to Hell ===\n[[image: doom02.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]When Thor led an unauthorized invasion of [[Slokovia]], a country neighboring Latveria, Doom aided the Avengers in fighting their rogue ally-manipulating events so that when Slokovia's government collapsed, Doom moved in and annexed the country, adding it to Latveria. Dr. Doom assisted in the birth of Reed and Susan's daughter [[Richards, Valeria|Valeria Richards]], who was named after Doom's childhood love, but Doom only performed this act of kindness as part of a grander scheme. Having recognized that it was in magic that he was truly Reed's superior, Doom forged an alliance with the [[Haazareth Three]] [[demons]] and sacrificed to them his greatest love, Valeria. The Haazareth increased his mystical might to the point where he was a threat to even Dr. Strange. Dr. Doom fashioned for himself new armor from his former lover's body and made Valeria Richards his familiar. He wielded his new mystical power against the Fantastic Four, attempting to break them as he never had before, sending Franklin Richards to [[Hell]] and torturing the FF. Once again, Reed defeated him by both mastering some magic himself and turning Doom's own pride against him by having him claim to acknowledge no superior in front of the Haazareth. The Haazareth took Doom into Hell with them, but he left \"parting gifts\"-- a traumatized Franklin and a scar down the left side of Reed's face.\n\nDetermined to devise a final solution to Doom, Reed created an infinitely large [[Mobius]] dimension to serve as Doom's prison, and had all of Doom's backup equipment in Latveria destroyed. Doom briefly escaped the prison by taking mental possession of the FF, but was ultimately forced back into his own body.\n\n=== Escape ===\nRecently, Doom escaped from the Mobius dimension while chasing after the [[Mjolnir]] (Thor's hammer) which was flying through the dimensions following the fall of [[Asgard]]. Returning to Latveria, Doom assumed that he was worthy of the hammer since it appeared for him and went with a troupe of robots to obtain it. He was met by the FF, who wished to stop him. Doom reached the hammer, but found he was not worthy of lifting it. Angered, Doom returned to Latveria, where he currently resides.",

            "bio": "Born in 1930, Stephen Strange was the eldest child of Eugene and Beverly Strange, then vacationing in Philadelphia. Two years later, Stephen's sister [[Strange, Donna|Donna]] was born at the family's Nebraska farm. At age eight, Strange was beset by demons controlled by apprentice sorcerer [[Baron Mordo|Karl Mordo]], but was rescued by Mordo's mentor, the [[Ancient One]], a millennia-old sorcerer who protected the Earth dimension as its Sorcerer Supreme, a role Strange was destined to inherit. At age eleven, a year or two after his brother [[Strange, Victor|Victor]]'s birth, Strange aided an injured Donna, the experience inspiring him to pursue a medical career.\n\nAfter high school, Strange entered pre-med at a New York college. Later, home on vacation for his nineteenth birthday, Strange went swimming with Donna, who suffered a cramp and drowned. Finding her body after a desperate search, Strange felt a sense of personal failure that eroded his medical idealism. After earning his medical degree in record time, he entered a five-year residency at New York Hospital, where his rapid success made him arrogant. When his mother Beverly died near the end of his residency, a bereaved Strange grew distant from his work. His talent was unaffected, though, and he became a wealthy, celebrated neurosurgeon before he turned thirty. His egotism made him cold and callous, interested only in high fees. He saved the life of injured United Nations translator, Madeleine Revell; following a romance and proposal, she left him due to his increasingly materialist nature. Two years after Beverly's death, her husband Eugene fell ill; unable to face another family death, Stephen refused to visit his deathbed. A few days later, an outraged Victor berated Stephen for his apparent lack of grief, then rushed from Strange's apartment into the path of an oncoming car. Blaming himself, Strange placed Victor's body in cold storage, half-hoping that future breakthroughs could revive him. \n\nCirca 1963, Strange was in a car accident that severely damaged the nerves in his hands, ending his surgical career. Too vain to accept positions as a consultant or assistant, Strange sought a cure and pursued every available treatment, legitimate or not, soon depleting his fortune; in months he was reduced to a derelict, performing shady medical procedures that barely paid his bar tabs. After hearing rumors of the mystical Ancient One, a desperate Strange pawned his last possessions for a ticket to the East and found the Ancient One's Tibetan palace. At first annoyed when the Ancient One refused to cure him, Strange was later astonished to see the sorcerer attacked by mystic forces. Upon learning that the Ancient One was Earth's magical defender and that the attack on him came from his pupil Mordo, Strange tried to warn him, but Mordo mystically prevented Strange from doing so. For the sake of the Ancient One and the world, Strange acted unselfishly for the first time in years, vowing to learn magic himself so he could counter Mordo and his ilk. He offered himself as a disciple to the Ancient One, who accepted, having known of Mordo's treachery all along. The Ancient One spent years instructing Strange in the art of sorcery, teaching him how to tap the innate mystic powers of both himself and the world around him, as well as how to invoke the power of awesome entities, or Principalities, who resided in their own realms, most notably the three benign beings known as the [[Vishanti]]. A few years after Strange's arrival, Mordo left to seek greater power, and would often clash with Strange in the future. Strange's guilt over his earlier mistakes weighed heavily upon him over the years, and not all of his early recollections can be trusted.\n\n[[image:DrStrangeInline.jpg|left]]During his years of study and early activity, Strange befriended many sorcerers around the world, including [[Lord Phyffe|Lord Julian Phyffe]] and [[Bentley, Clive|Sir Clive Bentley]] of Great Britain; [[Spinosa, Alfeo|Cardinal Alfeo Spinosa]] and [[Count Carezzi]] of Italy; [[Karindu, Omar|Omar Karindu]], [[Kaliph, Rama|Rama Kaliph]], and [[Barim, Turhan|Turhan Barim]] of the Middle East; [[Yee, Wai Chee|Wai Chee Yee]] and [[Sen-Yu]] of Asia; and [[Kane, Aleister|Aleister Kane]], [[Ward, Kenneth|Kenneth Ward]], and [[Brukner, Frank|Frank Brukner]] of America. Other immortal adventurers, such as [[Immortalis]] and [[Terror, Inc.]], regarded his ascent with skepticism. Strange also found allies among more earthly heroes, aiding the adventurer [[Black Fox]] in at least two adventures. No later than the 1970s, Strange returned to America, becoming a mystic consultant in New York's Greenwich Village. He was joined by [[Wong]], the descendant of a line that had served the Ancient One for centuries, who became his servant and friend. Strange's earliest foes included the demonic [[Bottle Imp]]; a nightmarish manifestation of the entity [[KhLΘg]]; and the [[Glossary:D#demon|demon]] [[Nightmare]], who preyed upon humanity's dreams and became one of Strange's bitterest enemies. Developing a mysterious reputation like the Ancient One before him, Strange became an occasional consultant to local and even federal authorities.\n\nWhile the [[Fantastic Four]]'s debut heralded an upsurge of superhuman activity in recent years, Strange remained aloof from New York's many super heroes at first. The powerful Asgardian god [[Loki]] later tricked Strange into covertly attacking Loki's heroic foster brother, [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]]; however, Strange soon pierced the deception and united with Thor to drive off Loki. Soon afterward, a clash with Mordo led Strange to encounter the young [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], who helped Strange rescue several people from a mystic dimension and convinced him to remove their memory of the traumatic experience, even though this caused them to forget Spider-Man's heroism as well. Impressed by Spider-Man's bravery and altruism, Strange came to regard him as a friend, and the two unlikely allies have teamed up many times over the years.\n\nStrange soon faced the Dreaded [[Dormammu]], ruler of the [[Dark Dimension]] and one of the Ancient One's oldest foes. Sensing the Ancient One's declining power, Dormammu plotted anew to invade the Earth dimension and challenged Strange to a [[Glossary:M#mystic|mystic]] duel in the Dark Dimension. While there, Strange was approached by [[Clea]], a novice mystic and daughter of Dormammu's sister [[Umar]], although few knew her parentage at the time. Clea sought to prevent the duel, fearful that her home dimension would be devastated by the [[Mindless Ones]] if its ruler fell, but Strange would not yield. Although Dormammu vastly out powered Strange, their duel drained his energies enough to weaken the barrier which contained the Mindless Ones. Strange, unwilling to endanger the Dark Dimension's denizens, lent Dormammu enough power to restore the barrier. Enraged by his own weakness, Dormammu felt honor-bound to spare Strange, who bargained with him to spare both the Earth dimension and Clea, whom he found very attractive; however, Dormammu swore vengeance and became one of Strange's most implacable enemies.\n\nShortly after this, Strange openly joined several super heroes in battling the powerful mutate [[Sundown]]. He became a special consultant to prominent super-teams like the Fantastic Four, the [[X-Men]] and the [[Avengers]]. Months after attending the wedding of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed]] and [[Invisible Woman|Sue Richards]], Strange was reunited with Clea, who returned his love and came to live with him in New York. Later, following an extradimensional ordeal, he was forced to change his appearance in order to cross the barrier to Earth; he altered his traditional attire and added a full-face mask, perhaps in imitation of his super-hero allies. Upon his return, Strange retained this appearance to preserve his anonymity but later carelessly revealed his real name to a crowd while fighting Nightmare. [[Eternity]], the universal embodiment whom Strange was aiding at the time, altered all documents and memories on Earth, changing the name of \"Stephen Strange\" to \"Stephen Sanders\" to allow Strange a private persona once more.\n\n[[image:DrStrangeInline3.jpg|right]]Strange next faced the [[Undying Ones]], a vastly powerful demon race led by the [[Nameless One]], who had once dominated Earth. During these struggles, Strange manipulated [[Sub-Mariner|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the monstrous [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] into aiding him. With the Undying Ones defeated, Strange seemingly believed that the Earth dimension was sealed from mystic incursion, and, troubled by his arrogant exploitation of Namor and Hulk, he abandoned his mystic duties and became a medical consultant, performing the selfless duties he had once thought beneath him.\n\nWeeks later, Strange returned to action when Baron Mordo tried to kill him. Aided by the Ancient One, Strange reclaimed his sorcerer role and defeated Mordo, while the Ancient One, for reasons of his own, reversed Eternity's spell, restoring the name \"Stephen Strange\" to the world's records and memories. When the Nameless One returned shortly thereafter, Strange resumed his non-masked attire and again recruited Namor and the Hulk to fight alongside him. The three heroes later fought other threats and were soon joined by the alien [[Silver Surfer]]. This quartet formed the core of the heroic [[Defenders]] team, becoming friends despite their differences.\n\nStrange soon clashed with powerful demon servants of [[Shuma-Gorath]], a vast extradimensional entity who had menaced Earth thousands of years ago and now sought to return via the mind of the Ancient One himself. At his mentor's prompting, Strange slew the Ancient One, preventing Shuma-Gorath's passage. The Ancient One's physical death made him one with Eternity, and Strange became Sorcerer Supreme, guardian of the entire universe. Heavily burdened by his new responsibilities and seeking the solace of family, Strange tried and failed to revive his brother Victor using spells from the [[Book of the Vishanti]], not realizing he was reading the Vampiric Verses, imbuing Victor with the potential for resurrection as a vampire. \n\nStrange continued to share adventures with the Defenders, and over the months the informal team's ranks expanded to include the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] [[Valkyrie]], the winged millionaire [[Nighthawk (Kyle Richmond)|Nighthawk]], the happy-go-lucky [[Hellcat]], and others. Strange's time with the team forced him to face more non-mystical foes, such as the mutant [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]], the alien [[Nebulon the Celestial Man]], the subversive [[Sons of the Serpent]] and the bizarre masterminds called the [[Headmen]]. Strange's sanctuary ([[Sanctum Sanctorum]]) often served as Defenders headquarters, and their camaraderie, plus the love of Clea, gave Strange a welcome change from his customary solitude.\n\nManipulated by the trans-temporal sorcerers called the [[Creators]], the Ancient One's spirit offered Strange a chance to become one with the universe, but Strange refused and was stripped of the title and power of Sorcerer Supreme. Shortly afterward, Strange battled the Creators, thwarting their reality-reshaping plans by defeating their ally, the cosmic [[In-Betweener]]. With their deception revealed, the Ancient One restored Strange's former status. Although Strange's adventure took mere days from his perspective, weeks apparently passed on Earth; who, if anyone, held the post of Sorcerer Supreme during these weeks is unrevealed.\n\nMonths later, Strange and the three other senior Defenders parted ways after a cosmic hoax by the mysterious alien [[Tribunals]] convinced them their alliance was destined to cause cosmic tragedy. Next allied with a band of [[Glossary:V#vampire|vampires]] hunters against [[Dracula]], Strange cast the Montesi Formula spell taken from the ancient magic tome the [[Darkhold]]. This spell destroyed virtually all vampires within the Earth dimension; however, unknown to Strange, the spell's energy washed over the forgotten Victor Strange, where its power combined unpredictably with Strange's earlier spell.\n\nMeanwhile, Clea had returned to the Dark Dimension to lead the rebellion against its current ruler, Umar, whom she soon learned was her mother. Strange helped Clea ascend to her home universe's throne, but, bound by their respective responsibilities, the couple regretfully separated. Strange next found those very responsibilities challenged by the evil extraterrestrial [[Urthona]], who coveted the role of Sorcerer Supreme. A desperate Strange destroyed his own collection of mystic artifacts and tomes to deny Urthona their power; unknown to Strange, his collection was in fact rescued by [[Agamotto]], one of three Principalities who formed the [[Vishanti]].\n\nWith the removal of Strange's artifacts, various occult threats that had been repelled by their power over the millennia broke free, leaving Strange to face them with reduced power. Accompanied by the extradimensional novice mystic [[Rintrah]], Strange encountered the Ancient One's old rival [[Kaluu]], who offered to teach him life-draining black magic as a defense against the returning forces; Strange reluctantly accepted. Strange's black magic ventures culminated in a rematch with Shuma-Gorath, which ended with the demon seemingly destroyed and Strange little better-off, but Strange eventually recovered and returned home. Shortly thereafter, he visited the Dark Dimension and married Clea, who came to live with him on Earth, ruling her kingdom from afar. Strange took Rintrah as his new apprentice, and a surreal encounter with Agamotto restored his seemingly lost artifacts and tomes.\n\nStrange faced a far more unexpected part of his past when his brother Victor revived as the first of a new breed of vampire. Victor fell under the sway of sorceress [[LaVeau, Marie|Marie LaVeau]], who sought to blackmail Strange into reciting the Vampiric Verses, nullifying the effects of the Montesi Formula. Strange instead banished the Vampiric Verses page from the Earth dimension, but Marie LaVeau used Victor as a template to duplicate the spell, making it possible for long-destroyed vampires to reappear. Unable to undo this threat, Strange and Clea were next drawn into a war between Dormammu and Umar for rule of the Dark Dimension; ultimately Umar reclaimed the throne, leaving Clea in exile with Strange. Strange next allied himself with several super heroes against the mad [[Titans (Eternals of Titan)|Titan]] [[Thanos]], who used the near-omnipotent [[Infinity Gauntlet]] to eradicate half of the universe's population before Earth's heroes defeated him and reversed the effect. \n\nAs Clea sought allies to regain the Dark Dimension, Strange formed alliances of his own by manipulating the formation of the [[Midnight Sons]], a loose-knit group of supernatural heroes, including those who had helped him invoke the Montesi Formula, destined to confront ancient evils. During Clea's absence, he briefly tutored the young sorcerer [[Phyffe, Augustyne|Augustyne Phyffe]], who ultimately chose to abandon sorcery. After sharing leadership of Earth's heroes against the [[Magus (Adam Warlock)|Magus]] during the [[Infinity War]], Strange teamed with Namor, the Hulk, and the Silver Surfer to battle [[Shanzar]], the invading Sorcerer Supreme of another dimension (by now, Strange had long since discovered the Tribunals' hoax and knew it was safe for the senior Defenders to reunite).\n\nMeanwhile, the Principalities of various mystic realms faced the [[War of the Seven Spheres]], a cataclysmic clash with opposing entities that was expected to last five thousand years. Several of them, including the Vishanti, attempted to enlist allies such as Strange, but Strange refused to abandon his earthly duties and, being no match for the godlike Principalities, renounced the use of their mystic energies. Thus stripped of much of his power, Strange was ill-prepared to face a vastly enhanced Dormammu, who had manipulated Clea's deposal of Umar so that he could again rule the Dark Dimension. Strange recruited the Hulk, the Silver Surfer, and the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] (Dan Ketch) to aid him in repelling Dormammu, who retained control of the Dark Dimension despite Strange's victory, and Clea remained there to lead the new resistance. Strange sought out Immortalis in hopes of curing Victor, but was refused due to the temporary nature of the cure. Shortly afterward, Rintrah was seemingly slain destroying a dangerous talisman, and Strange, after placing Rintrah's body in stasis pending potential revival, took as a new apprentice [[Wildpride|Kyllian Kell]], a youth empowered by [[Tuatha De Danaan|Celtic gods]]. Strange also began periodically gathering informal teams of heroes as \"[[Secret Defenders]]\" to face threats he could not handle alone.\n\n[[image:DrStrangeInline2.jpg|left]]Strange was among the heroes mesmerized by the [[Goddess]], who sought to remake the universe through her [[Infinity Crusade]]. While Strange's physical form served the Goddess, his astral form investigated the actions of Victor Strange, now the costumed hero Khiron, who had become too deadly a vigilante for Strange's liking. Realizing how violent he had become, Khiron took his own life, but Strange had little time to mourn; shortly after breaking free of the Goddess, Strange again faced Urthona, who had enlisted in the War of the Seven Spheres and had thus gained as much power as Strange had lost. Surviving this encounter, Strange tried to rescue Kyllian from a mystic dimension but left him behind when called to join the Midnight Sons against the ancient sorceress [[Lilith (Mother Of Demons)|Lilith]]; weeks later, Kyllian returned in the enhanced form of Wildpride, later fighting both Strange and the Midnight Sons. Joining an international coalition of heroes in opposing the techno-magical threat of [[Mys-Tech]]'s [[Un-Earth]], Strange was one of six beings who stabilized the resulting unraveled reality. \n\nStrange's life was further complicated by [[Salomé]], a winged member of the mysterious [[Blood]] race and allegedly the first Earth-born Sorcerer Supreme over 20,000 years ago. With Strange's power still low, Salomé easily reclaimed her title; however, she cared little for humanity and began gathering followers to help her rule the Earth. Desperate for more power, Strange secluded himself in a pocket dimension, from which he dispatched two magical constructs based upon himself: Vincent Stevens, who built a fortune with which to develop so-called technomagick, and a being called Strange, who fought alongside the Midnight Sons and gathered objects of mystic power throughout the world. Unable to spare the energy to lead the Secret Defenders, Dr. Strange abruptly forced this responsibility upon another former student of the Ancient One, [[Doctor Druid]], who served as best he could yet was ultimately unable to maintain the operation. \n\nDr. Strange had barely finished enhancing his sorcery when Stevens and Strange rebelled against him; in the resulting clash, Stevens was apparently destroyed, and Strange went to the Dark Dimension, where he merged with the rebellion's Nobel as [[Paradox]], working beside Clea. Using elemental magic to defeat Salomé, Dr. Strange assumed a short-lived younger form and briefly adopted a more violent persona to shut down illegal operations engineered by Stevens. However, Dr. Strange's plans were interrupted when the Vishanti once again demanded his service in the War of the Seven Spheres. Unwilling to risk yet another loss of power, Strange complied.\n\nAlthough Strange spent five thousand years fighting for the Vishanti against the mysterious [[Trinity of Ashes]], he returned to Earth with little sign of physical age, only a few months after he had departed, his memories of the war largely suppressed; again, it is not known if anyone carried out Strange's duties in his absence. Having exhausted his typical powers, Strange sought new ones through the use of unpredictable Catastrophe Magic, which he later supplemented with so-called Chaos Magic; however, Strange later claimed there was no such thing as Chaos Magic, confusing matters considerably. In any event, Strange eventually regained the patronage of the Principalities, his powers restored to their height. Dormammu used the mutant [[White, Jonathon|Jonathon White]] and Strange's ally [[Topaz]] against the mage, but Strange drove off his enemy and magically guided another surgeon to save Topaz from Dormammu's attack.\n\nAnother sort of status quo returned when the extradimensional techno-mage [[Yandroth]], an old foe of both Strange and the Defenders, unleashed destructive forces upon the Earth. Strange, Namor, Hulk and the Surfer united against Yandroth, but time had made them less compatible. When Yandroth seemingly perished, he used Earth's magical energy to bind the quarrelsome quartet with a spiteful curse that would force them together against all future threats to Earth, regardless of their other concerns. Other Defenders alumni lent their aid in coping with this situation, and Strange, although irritated by Yandroth's curse, was not untouched by the renewed camaraderie of his fellow heroes. However, the curse magnified the anger and egos of the four senior Defenders until they became mentally unstable and, as the [[Order]], sought to end all threats to the Earth by taking control of it. Several other heroes, including Clea, fought them, and the energies unleashed by the battle were harnessed to resurrect Yandroth in a powerful new form. Shocked back to their senses by this development, the four Defenders stopped fighting, which reduced Yandroth to human form. Yandroth was defeated and imprisoned.\n\nShaken by his misuse of power and position, Strange cut himself off from his super-hero allies, even becoming aloof from his longtime friend Spider-Man. When the idealistic mystic Topaz became Strange's fifth known disciple, he held her at an emotional distance and, when she disobeyed him in the aftermath of a mystic threat, he dismissed her. Although Strange continues to defend the Earth dimension and to assist fellow heroes as needed, his old arrogance has resurfaced, and his ultimate role in recent upheavals within the superhuman community remains to be seen.\n\nFor other people known as Doctor Strange, see [[Doctor Strange (disambiguation)]].",

In addition, he can override electrically powered devices and manipulate them mentally, travel along conductive surfaces (such as power lines) at speeds as fast as 140 mph, create electrostatic \"bridges\" to travel varying distances and disrupt Spider-Man's ability to cling to walls. When fully charged, however, Electro becomes extremely sensitive to anything that can \"short circuit\" his abilities, particularly water.",

Instead of being killed, the freak accident caused a mutagenic change in his nervous system, allowing him to generate and control vast amounts of electricity. After creating a colorful costume, Max turned to a life of crime as Electro.\n\nAt the beginning of Electro's criminal career, [[Jameson, J. Jonah|J.Jonah Jameson]] began a smear campaign in the [[Daily Bugle (Building)|Daily Bugle]] proclaiming Electro to actually be an alter-ego for Spider-man. Intent on proving the publisher wrong, Spider-man faced Electro and was nearly killed by merely touching him. Using a fire hose, however, the web-slinger was able to defeat Electro. Sometime later in another attempt to deface Spider-man's reputation, Jameson secured Electro's supercharged services to battle the web-slinger on national television. Before an audience of millions, Spider-Man stood triumphant once more. Dillon was humiliated.\n\n[[Image:Electro03.jpeg|thumb|200px|left]]After a string of embarrassing defeats, decided to test his strength in numbers as a member of the [[Sinister Six]], alongside [[Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)|Doctor Octopus]], [[Kraven (Sergei Kravinoff)|Kraven the Hunter]], [[Sandman (William Baker)|Sandman]], [[Mysterio (Quentin Beck)|Mysterio]] and the [[Vulture (Adrian Toomes)|Vulture]]. Drawing numbers, the plan was for each villain to face Spider-man in a different location that drew upon their respective talents one by one until one of them was victorious. However, they were eventually defeated and imprisoned.\n\nIn an attempt to win himself the glory and respect that had alluded him so frequently, Dillon tried to devise a master plan to control New York City's power supply. However, he was once again defeated by Spider-man and convinced to quit his criminal career...if only temporarily. He resurfaced as a member of the next incarnation of the Sinister Six, with [[Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale)|Hobgoblin]] replacing the deceased Kraven the Hunter. Doctor Octopus betrayed the group and they were subsequently disbanded. \n\nElectro was also a member of Mysterio's Sinister Seven, created to combat Spider-Man's insane, homicidal clone, [[Kaine]]. However, Kaine disappeared and with no further need to keep the group together, it was disbanded and Dillon returned to his self imposed exile  \n\nHe was once again brought out of retirement by the [[Rose (Jacob Connover)|Rose]], who offered Dillon the chance at an experimental procedure to greatly enhance his abilities in exchange for his services as an underworld enforcer. Dillon and agreed, sensing the opportunity to rise above his past failures. After undergoing the procedure and dispatching several members of the True Believers, an offshoot of the [[Hand]] at the request of the Rose, Dillon returned to his original plan of taking over the New York City power supply. Once again defeated by Spider-Man, who had donned an insulated suit, a frustrated Dillon threw himself into the Hudson River, apparently killing himself. \n[[Image:Electro02.jpeg|thumb|200px|left]]\nHowever, Dillon survived as he reappeared as part of the next series of subsequent incarnations of the Sinister Six, each of which were either defeated or disbanded due to internal conflicts. The most recent incarnation, the [[Sinister Twelve]], gathered by the [[Green Goblin (Norman Osborn)|Green Goblin]] as part of a larger plan to enable his escape from prison and destroy Spider-Man. They were defeated with the help of the combined efforts of [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]], [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]], [[Yellowjacket (Henry Pym)|Yellowjacket]] and the [[Fantastic Four]].\n\nElectro was hired by [[Brainchild]] to free [[Sauron|Karl Lykos]] from the Raft, a maximum-security prison designed to hold supervillians. Electro initiated a prison break the likes of which had never been seen, releasing scores of criminals. However, his actions also brought together a number of the world's most powerful heroes to contain the disaster including: Captain America, Iron Man, [[Cage, Luke|Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], Matt Murdock, [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] and Spider-Man, many of whom were trapped in the [[Raft]] when the power was shut off. With the exception of Daredevil (and Sentry at first), this impromptu gathering of heroes reunited shortly after the prison break to form a new [[Avengers]] team. Dillon tried to escape with his girlfriend, a waitress in Boston, but was captured by the new Avengers, the very team he inadvertently helped create.",

            "bio": "<br>\n\n=== The Origin ===\nThe Fantastic Four is an internationally-renowned group of superhuman champions (often dubbed the world's premiere super hero team or the first family of super heroes) based in New York City and dedicated to the betterment of the world through scientific discovery and defense against evil.\n\nIt all started with a rushed test flight of an experimental spacecraft. Years before, while a student at [[Empire State University]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] began working on plans for one of the first vehicles capable interstellar travel. His roommate and best friend, [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Benjamin Grimm]], jokingly promised to pilot the craft. But Reed, after studying to be an aeronautical engineer, finally realized his lifelong dream. Exhausting the majority of his vast inheritance, he funded the construction and launch of such a starship. Other financers, particularly the U.S. government, however, were losing interest and they threatened to cut him off from their funding of the project. Reed embarked on an immediate test flight, taking Ben Grimm with him who had become a successful Air Force pilot. Reed's longtime sweetheart and fiancée, [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], and her brother, [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Johnny]], also joined them. Ben opposed the idea, warning that the ship's shielding might prove inadequate against intense forms of [[Glossary:C#cosmic radiation|cosmic radiation]]. Nevertheless, Reed persuaded them all to accompany him, stealing into the launch facility, boarding the starship, and blasting off in pursuit of scientific glory. They intended to travel to another star system and back, but a solar flare temporarily boosted the intensity of the ionizing radiation in Earth's Van Allen belt. \n\nThe spaceship encountered a bombardment of cosmic radiation, causing both the mission to be aborted and the craft to crash. Emerging from the ruins of the spaceship, they discovered the radiation had mutated their bodies. Reed gained the ability to stretch his body and limbs, Johnny was able to fly and become engulfed in flame, and Sue was able to bend light around her body and become invisible. Ben, on the other hand, gained incredible strength and durability at the cost of being severely disfigured. All four decided to use their powers to better humanity and founded the Fantastic Four.\n\n=== Setting Up Shop ===\n[[image:Fantastic_FourHead.jpg|left|thumb]]Calling themselves Mister Fantastic, the Thing, the Human Torch and the Invisible Girl, the four established their headquarters atop the [[Baxter Building]] in midtown Manhattan - a building originally erected in 1949 by the Baxter Paper Company and since owned by a number of other corporations. [[Baxter, Noah|Noah Baxter]], a friend and fellow inventor, helped Reed Richards purchase the Baxter building. Then, financed by profits from the patents on Reed's inventions, the Fantastic Four set out to safeguard the world from any and all threats beyond the purview of conventional peacekeeping forces.\n\n=== Early Successes ===\nThe team first put its abilities on public display when the subterranean [[Mole Man]] attempted to take revenge on the surface world by destroying Earth's power plants and unleashing an army of gigantic monsters to annihilate the human race. But the Fantastic Four turned back the Mole Man's threat. After this and many more public adventures, the Four soon became worldwide celebrities, and their exploits were recounted in newspapers, on television, and in comic books. The heroes also have been on the forefront of scientific discovery, such as the discovery of the parallel dimension known as the [[Negative Zone]], the first public contact with alien races such as the [[Skrulls]] and [[Kree]], the discovery of the hidden civilization of the [[Inhumans]] and the secret African nation of [[Wakanda]], as well as being the first humans to step foot on the moon - alongside the [[Red Ghost]].\n\n=== The Roster Fluctuates ===\nMonths after their public appearance, Reed and Sue were married, which became a celebrity event. The two enjoyed a healthy marriage despite the Four's constant public scrutiny for many years. However, the two fell into an estrangement at one point, with Sue dissatisfied with the public life as a superhero celebrity. She briefly left the team and the Inhuman known as [[Medusa]] filled her spot on the team before Sue's return. In another membership shake-up, when Ben Grimm temporarily lost his powers, Reed Richards hired the mercenary [[Cage, Luke|Power Man]] to take over his place on the team, but this lasted only until Reed could finish an armored exoskeleton for Ben. Later, Reed and Sue had a son, [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin]]. During Sue's maternity leave, the Four's long-standing ally (and girlfriend of the Torch), [[Crystal]], joined the team, until an allergic reaction to Earth's pollutants pushed her to quit and forced the rest of the Inhumans to leave Earth. Sue soon returned to active duty.\n\nAt one point, the Fantastic Four were among the various heroes transported to a planet created by the alien [[Maker|Beyonder]] for the first of the so-called \"[[Secret Wars]]\".  After defeating the Beyonder, the Thing refused to return to Earth with the heroes, happy to have found the ability to transform into his human form at will. His position on the team was filled by the [[She-Hulk]], who had been similarly transported to the planet. When the Thing returned months later, he was distraught to find that his former girlfriend, [[Masters, Alicia|Alicia Masters]], had begun an affair with his teammate, Johnny Storm. The Thing quit the Fantastic Four to wander the country for a time, and She-Hulk remained in his stead.\n\n=== A Stessful Place to Live ===\nThe Fantastic Four resided at the Baxter Building for many years, through various villain attacks, which often destroyed multiple floors and caused most of the other residents to abandon the building. However, one time, [[Doctor Doom (Kristoff Vernard)|Kristoff Vernard]] - a youth who had been programmed to believe he was [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]] - shot the building into space and destroyed it. Afterwards, instead of rebuilding the old building, Reed Richards designed and oversaw the construction of a new tower, named [[Four Freedoms Plaza]].    \n\n=== The More Things Change... ===\nThe three original members of the Fantastic Four later found the Thing in the Mole Man's realm, where they discovered the Mole Man trying to raise a continent in the Pacific and threatening to destroy California. The Thing rejoined the team after helping to stop the Mole Man, and She-Hulk left to other pursuits. Soon after, Reed and Sue Richards announced they were leaving the Four to raise their son in relative normalcy. The Thing became head of the group, and proved to be an able, levelheaded leader, despite the fact that Johnny had just married Alicia Masters (although it was later revealed that this Alicia had been replaced by the shape-shifting alien Skrull, [[Lyja]]). Ben and Johnny were joined by Crystal and [[Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura)|Ms. Marvel]], a hero the Thing had met during his time away from the Four. During one adventure, both the Thing and Ms. Marvel were subject to another shuttle accident, bombarding them both with cosmic rays. This mutated Ben further and turned Sharon into a She-Thing. \n\n=== The Four Reassembled ===\nWhen the villain Nanny and her Orphan-maker kidnapped Franklin, Sue and Reed were drawn into adventuring alongside [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] (then known as the Captain) and a re-forming of the [[Avengers]]. But once the Avengers were re-established, Sue and Reed left and returned to the Fantastic Four once again. During this time, Ms. Marvel was lost on a mission to the European nation of [[Latveria]], having been manipulated by Doctor Doom and other of the FF's villains, before finally leaving to seek refuge with [[Wingfoot, Wyatt|Wyatt Wingfoot]]. Crystal also left, opting to return to her Inhuman family.  \n\n=== More Architectural Upheaval ===\nLike its previous incarnation, Four Freedoms Plaza also had its share of attacks, culminating in a gamma bomb explosion set off by a of doppelganger Reed Richards during the \"[[Infinity War]]\", which blew the top floors off, including the giant number fours that surrounded the roof. Lacking the finances to fix it, the majority of the damage stayed for many years. \n\n=== Family Affairs ===\nLater, Franklin was kidnapped by [[Richards, Nathaniel|Nathaniel Richards]], the time-traveling scientist and father of Reed Richards.  Nathaniel believe that Franklin's powers were a threat to all existence, and so allowed him to age under his strict tutelage in a point in the distant future, returning him to his family moments after his abduction and aged to a teenager. Franklin was hard-pressed to reconcile with his family, and at the same time, he formed a sister team to the Fantastic Four - dubbed the [[Fantastic Force]]. \n\n=== A Death on the Team ===\nAt one point, Doctor Doom lured a powerful alien entity to his nation of Latveria, coveting its power. The entity began laying waste to the countryside and the Fantastic Four arrived to investigate. Doom tricked the team into continue fighting the creature while he appropriated a portion of its energies to boost his own power. Confronting the alien directly, Doom eventually teleported the alien away, but was left soundly defeated and lay dying. Reed offered his aid, but Doom used the remaining power in his armor to disintegrate himself and his archenemy. Sue refused to believe her husband had died, although she nevertheless assumed leadership of the team. She also hired [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] to supervise and care for the Four's equipment, and she formed an alliance with the [[Sub-Mariner]] so that the ranks of the Fantastic Four would not be weakened. During this time, Lyja had returned to attempt reconciliation with Johnny and Kristoff von Doom had been discovered to be alive. Both became staunch allies of the Four.\n\n=== Revelations and Returns ===\nEventually, the team discovered that Reed and Doctor Doom did not die, but were snatched moments before death by the villain [[Hyperstorm]]. The Four had tracked them to Hyperstorm's dimension, discovering Doom and, later, Reed Richards. Doom was able to escape with the help of Kristoff and tried to siphon Hyperstorm's power for himself. Instead, Hyperstorm used his powers to return Doom to his proper place and time. The Fantastic Four managed to defeat the villain with the help of the planet-devouring [[Galactus]]. Upon the Four's return, Ant-Man, the Sub-Mariner, and Lyja soon parted company. Also during this time, Nathaniel Richards allowed Franklin to revert to his rightful age, and the Fantastic Force was disbanded.\n\n=== Heroes Reborn ===\nSoon afterward, the Fantastic Four were caught up in a battle with the psychic being known as [[Onslaught (entity)|Onslaught]]. To defeat the villain, the active members of the Four, as well as their allies (which included the Avengers, the Inhumans, Doctor Doom, and others), seemingly sacrificed themselves to contain its energies. As a result, the Fantastic Four were believed dead. The government was inclined to appropriate the Four's equipment, but instead Nathaniel Richards used time-traveling devices to shunt all of it to the Negative Zone. Nathaniel also took charge of Kristoff and disappeared into the future. In reality, the Fantastic Four were saved by Franklin, who through his reality-altering powers bodily recreated them and others who died into an [[Counter-Earth (Richards)|alternate dimension]]. Eventually, Franklin Richards was forced to bring his created world into true reality, thus bringing the Fantastic Four and the other heroes back to Earth. \n\n=== Trading Spaces ===\nIn the meantime, believing the FF dead, the [[Thunderbolts]] took over residency of Four Freedoms Plaza. When the Four finally returned, they gave up their home for a new warehouse headquarters, called [[Pier 4]]. Shortly after, however, the Fantastic Four were confronted by lawyers representing the [[Gideon Trust]], a consortium of investors who inherited the actions and debts of the late [[Gideon, Gregory|Gregory Gideon]], an early adversary of Four. The Trust hoped to buy Pier 4 and all its inventions and technology, which would thus save the stock of Richards Inc., as it had been losing value during the time the Fantastic Four were believed dead. The Richards agreed, although yet again they were forced to move when a villain, this time [[Diablo (Esteban De Ablo)| Diablo]], destroyed Pier 4. However, during negotiations with the Gideon Trust, Reed revealed he had commenced work on an all-new Baxter Building with the help of Noah Baxter. With Pier 4 destroyed, the team brought the new Baxter Building online and teleported it in place of the old Four Freedoms Plaza. \n\n=== Learning the Ways of Magic ===\nMore recently, Doctor Doom abandoned his technological prowess for the study and mastery of magic in order to defeat the Fantastic Four. Doom was able to capture the Four and to trap the Richards' son Franklin in Hell itself. He tortured the Four while leaving Reed imprisoned in an arcane library. Hoping to humiliate his rival, Doom forced Reed to find an escape by using the magic available in the library. The spirit form of Doctor Strange appeared and helped Reed escape, then gave him a magical device capable of breaching Doom's defenses. In the final battle, Reed succeeded in freeing his son from Hell and trapping Doom inside.\n\n=== To Hell and Back ===\nReed then embarked on a plan that would completely rid the world of Doom's weapons of mass destruction and free his oppressed people of Latveria. The United Nations warned Reed not to take international law into his own hands, but when met with Reed's indifference, the UN sent a multinational strike force to undo Reed's coup d'etat. Reed also neglected to fully explain his plans to the other members on the team, which alienating them in turn. Reed, for his part, was completing the second part of his plan to ensure that Doom would remain trapped from Earth's dimension forever. Reed hoped to exile himself into the same pocket-dimension prison as Doom so that he could personally make sure Doom would never escape. However he kept his true agenda a secret from his family, and in the end, the rest of the Fantastic Four entered the dimension as well. This allowed Doctor Doom to escape using his mind-swapping abilities, hitching a ride back to Earth in the body of the Invisible Woman. Doom continued to switch bodies among the Four during the battle that raged between the Four, Doom, and the UN as well. Doom ultimately transferred his mind into the Thing's rocky form. Doom then manipulated Richards into obliterating his enemy the only way possible: by killing the Thing.\n\nThe trauma of the Thing's death tore the family apart. Richards, however, determined a spark of life remained in the Thing's body and led the remaining members of the Fantastic Four into Heaven itself in hopes of retrieving his friend's soul. Ultimately, the Thing agreed to return from Heaven rather than allow Richards to blame himself for Ben's death.\n\nIn addition, Richard's involvement with Latveria nearly branded the team as traitors. With its public relations severely undercut, Richards forfeited his patents to the government to avoid imprisonment. This left the team broke and virtual social pariahs. The Fantastic Four continue to explore the ordinary and the extraordinary, to fight evil and to adventure, while also starting from scratch to rebuild their fortune and their good name.  \n\n=== ...A Little Help From their Friends ===\nOver the years the Fantastic Four have earned many friends and have relied on many family members to lend them assistance, or in the case of the witch [[Harkness, Agatha|Agatha Harkness]], baby-sitting. Their list of heroic friends includes [[Black Panther (T'Challa)|Black Panther]], [[Black Bolt]], [[Wingfoot, Wyatt|Wyatt Wingfoot]], [[Thundra]], the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Tigra]], and even a very brief, and unofficial, replacement FF consisting of [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]], [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], and the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]]. Some of their super-powered family members have also joined them in their adventures, including [[Richards, Valeria|Valeria Richards]] (believed for a while to be an alternate-timeline child of Sue Storm and Victor Von Doom, reverted to an infant).  \n\n=== A Laundry List of Foes ===\nThough the Fantastic Four have made many friends, they potentially made even more enemies.  They have fought, and won, against the worse that the galaxy has to offer; villains like Doctor Doom, an alternate future version of [[Doom (2099)|Doom]], [[Annihilus]], the [[Wizard]], the [[Skrulls]], including the [[Super Skrull]] and [[Paibok|Paibok the Power Skrull]], [[Blastaar]], the [[Mole Man]], and the world-devouring Galactus and his many heralds. \n\n=== In the End... ===\nThey have traveled across the planet, saving the world in their various versions of the [[Fantasticar]], as well as across the entire universe, the [[Negative Zone]], and into many different alternate universes and futures. The Fantastic Four have also come across, and survived meeting, beings of immense power; such as the [[Molecule Man]], the Beyonder, and [[Uatu The Watcher]]. They have participated in the beginning of the universe, stood in the presence of entities beyond human comprehension, and even destroyed an ancient member of the mysterious race of eternal beings known as the [[Celestials]].\n\nYet through this all they remain close friends and, most importantly, a family.",

            "bio": "Emma Frost was born into a wealthy old Boston mercantile family that arrived from England in the 1600s.  The second of three daughters, Emma also had an older brother named [[Frost, Christian|Christian]] who had turned to substance abuse as an escape from the drudgery of his life.  Unknown to their family or themselves, the three Frost sisters were mutants whose telepathic abilities matured upon reaching puberty.\n\n\nWhen it came time for their father to choose a worthy heir to the family fortune, Christian was automatically dismissed due to his drug problem.  Whilst the older sister [[Frost, Adrienne|Adrienne]] seemed the most obvious choice, the father chose Emma.  Surprisingly, she refused, choosing to make her own way through life.\n\n\nEmma ultimately inherited a good deal of wealth, but most of her large fortune resulted from her professional success. She ascended rapidly to the upper echelon of the business world on the strength of her intelligence, drive, and personal charm, as well as the secret use of her mental powers. Also, at some point, the [[Dark Beast]] met Emma, and helped her rise to wealth and power.\n\n\nEventually, Emma became majority stockholder of a multi-billion dollar conglomerate principally involved in electronics and transportation - both the building of ships and aircraft, and their use for freight and passenger conveyance. Despite her relative youth, she was named chairwoman of the board and chief executive officer of the rechristened Frost International. She also became headmistress and chairwoman of the board of trustees of the Massachusetts Academy - a college preparatory school for students in grades seven through twelve located in the Berkshire Mountains in Snow Valley, Massachusetts.\n\n\n[[image: emma01.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]Emma's success caught the attention of the [[Hellfire Club]], an elite social organization consisting of the world's wealthiest and most powerful figures. When she learned that the club was hiring dancers, she promptly auditioned and used her telepathic talents to enhance her performance in their eyes. Unlike the other females in the Club, Emma was never uncomfortable with the strict dress code that required female members to wear lingerie at all times. She believed her revealing wardrobe to be one of many weapons in her arsenal, one that gave her an instant advantage over men.\n\n\nFrost quickly became an ally of [[Shaw, Sebastian|Sebastian Shaw]], a member of the club's Council of the Chosen who were secretly conspiring to achieve world domination through economic and political means. At the time, the leaders of the club and council - its foremost Lords Cardinal, whose titles corresponded to the names of chess pieces - were White King [[Edward Buckman]] and White Queen [[Paris Seville]].\n\n\nBuckman threw the council's support behind [[Project: Armageddon]], scientist Steven Lang's program to construct mutant-hunting Sentinel robots. Aware of Shaw's genetic disposition, Buckman told him the initiative's intent was to capture mutants as a means of helping the council attain power. Using her psionic powers, Emma learned that the project's actual purpose was the annihilation of all genetic deviants. After Shaw's lover, [[Lourdes Chantel]], was murdered by one of the Sentinels, Shaw and Frost staged a coup that saw them seize control of the Council of the Chosen, which they renamed the Inner Circle. Shaw took the title of Black King, and Frost became the new White Queen.\n\n\nUnder Shaw and Frost's leadership, mutants dominated the Inner Circle. To strengthen the Club's power base, Emma recruited genetically gifted youngsters and helped them hone their abilities at her school. Most of these students were members of the [[Hellions]], Emma's first mutant super-team. She initially encountered the outlaw band of heroic mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]] when she unsuccessfully attempted to recruit young [[Pryde, Kitty|Kitty Pryde]], the phase-shifting mutant then known as Shadowcat. Subsequently, Emma crossed paths with the X-Men - and their protégés, the [[New Mutants]] - on a number of occasions, often as their adversary. Later, the X-Men joined with the Hellions to protect the White Queen from the time-traveling terrorist named [[Trevor Fitzroy]]. However, the madman's brutal assault plunged Emma into a deep coma and brought about the Hellions' untimely demise.\n\nWhilst Emma's consciousness still active on the material plane, her body was kept in the med-lab at the X-Men's mansion. Seeking to ensure her students' welfare and the school's future, Emma had willed responsibility for the Massachusetts Academy to Professor [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], the X-Men's telepathic founder. During her psychic incapacitation, the school was added to the rapidly expanding Xavier Institute. While Emma’s corporeal form was in stasis, a short-circuit in the mansion inadvertently caused her psyche to possess the X-Man named Iceman, whilst his mind was transferred into her body.\n\n\nCoerced by Professor X, Emma eventually reclaimed her own form. After making a full recovery, she resumed her role as headmistress of the academy. Ably assisted by Sean Cassidy, the sonically empowered former X-Man known as [[Banshee]], she set out to train a new crop of young mutants: [[Generation X]]. When the sinking stock market dealt Frost International a major blow, Emma swallowed her pride and sought the help of her older sister, Adrienne, who agreed to support her sibling's flagging financial interests only if she were named co-headmaster. But Adrienne's power play did not wind down when Emma acceded to her request, nor did it end when she supplanted her sister as the Hellfire Club's White Queen. Only after Adrienne telepathically incited a riot at the school did Emma find a way to upset her ascension: the way of the gun. Emma shot and killed her sister, thereby laying claim to Adrienne's inheritance.\n\n\n\n[[image: emma02.jpg|left|205px|thumb]]Following the dissolution of Generation X and the closure of the Massachusetts Academy, Emma moved to the island nation of Genosha where she began teaching mutant children again.  Soon after, a Sentinel attack wiped out Genosha's entire mutant population. Emma was found by the X-Men alive in the rubble, having undergone a secondary mutagenic change that allowed her to survive the onslaught.  Following this incident, Emma came to teach at the Xavier Institute, and soon took on the responsibility of personally mentoring the telepathic quintuplets known as the [[Stepford Cuckoos]].\n\n\nEmma later counseled her teammate [[Cyclops (Scott Summers)|Cyclops]] following his possession by the eternal mutant warlord [[Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)|Apocalypse]].  This soon turned into a telepathic affair between the two which was short-lived after Summers' wife, [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Jean Grey]], discovered what was happening.\n\n\nDuring the riot at the Xavier Institute, Sophie of the telepathic sisters the Stepford Cuckoos died. The remaining sisters blamed Emma for this and told Jean Grey-Summers of Emma's affair with her husband. When Emma was confronted by Jean, she was forced to relive various moments of her past. Following this confrontation, Emma was shot with a diamond bullet whilst in her diamond form, shattering it. Though she was believed to be dead at first, Emma's consciousness was trapped in her shattered remains. Phoenix discovered this and telekinetically fused Emma's body back together. Upon being reassembled, Emma identified Esme of the Cuckoos as the culprit behind her assassination. However, Esme was working with the X-Man [[Xorn]], who believed himself to be Magneto at the time, and it was he who shot Emma as she had learned of his dual identity.\n\n\n[[image: EMMA_CYCLOPS.jpg|right|300px|thumb]]Following the death of Jean Grey, Emma has assumed the position of co-headmaster of the Xavier Institute alongside Cyclops.\n\n\nWhen a band of [[Shi'ar]] reconstituted the [[Phoenix Force]] in order to destroy it, they ended up shattering it and driving it insane. It went to earth and forcefully resurrected Jean Grey, believing it needed Scott Summers when what it needed was the energy from his optic blasts. Emma attempted to shield Scott with her mind, but was stopped by [[Kid Omega|Quentin Quire]], who sought to use the Phoenix Force to resurrect Sophie of the Cuckoos. Emma offered herself as a host for the Phoenix Force so it could be contained but was quickly overpowered and her body was completely taken over by the Force. After temporarily resurrecting Sophie, who rejected Quentin, the Phoenix proceeded to burn the planet. Jean Grey separated Emma and remerged with the Force, only to fall into insanity. Emma used her powers to contact every X-Man in the world and their love for Jean restored the Phoenix's sanity, who became the White Phoenix and returned to the [[White Hot Room]] to find her missing pieces.",

Untold billions of years ago, he was born the humanoid Galan on the planet [[Taa]], a wondrous paradise of scientific and social achievement; however, his universe was in its final stages, with all matter plunging towards a central point via the \"Big Crunch\", collapsing into a new \"[[Cosmic Egg]]\", a sphere of disorganized, compact primordial matter. Galan, a space explorer, discovered a radiation-plague threatening all of Taa. Though he was initially scoffed at, the truth became clear as the people of surrounding planets perished. Despite the efforts of Taa's greatest scientists, no cure could be found, and the population began to die off. Galan convinced the handful of remaining survivors to die gloriously by flying a starship into the blazing cosmic cauldron. The others were killed by the intense radiation, but Galan was filled with new energy and saved by the [[Phoenix Force]] of the dying universe. The sentient energy spoke to Galan as it brought him into the Egg.\n\n=== Rebirth ===\nWith the next Big Bang, the Cosmic Egg matter exploded outwards, eventually condensing into stars and planets. The future Galactus and his starship were re-created simultaneously with the embodiments of [[Eternity]] and [[Death (embodiment)|Death]], though he drifted inert for billions of years while new life began to populate the universe. The starship crashed on an unnamed planet, where [[Ecce The Watcher]] saw its occupant emerge as raw energy. Ecce recognized the danger the nascent being would pose and could have destroyed him then, but instead abides by his oath of non-interference. Launching his ship back into space, the being ejected its lifeless companions into the void, there to drift in endless flight. He then created a suit of armor to harness and regulate his awesome energies, and transformed his ship into an incubation chamber, where he spent countless centuries evolving into his current form. Eventually his craft again fell into orbit around a verdant planet, [[Archeopia]]. The advanced natives scanned the craft, detected its awesome energies, and wisely left it undisturbed.\n\n=== The Giant Awakens ===\nYears later, when interstellar war spread into that space sector, the Archeopians' unidentified enemies mistook the incubation craft for a weapon and fired upon it. Emerging unscathed, the being who adopted the name Galactus swiftly slaughtered invader and defender alike, then consumed the life-energies of Archeopia, the first of many worlds that would perish for his hunger; only a small fleet of Archeopians managed to escape. Surveying the destruction he had wrought, Galactus decided to create a world to outshine any other in existence. Though it took millennia, including breaks to replenish his energies, Galactus completed ''Taa II'', an immense ship engulfing the entire Archeopian system, which he made his new home.\n\n=== The Hunger Grows ===\nGalactus initially went centuries between feedings, seeking out uninhabited worlds that could support life; but he gradually hungered more frequently, and began consuming inhabited worlds if he could find no others. He rationalized his actions by deeming himself a higher being, a belief made easier after learning of a prophecy that he would eventually compensate for all his destruction. In addition, he eventually encountered Eternity and Death, and the three beings hypothesized that Galactus represented a balancing force between the two opposites. \n\n=== Companionship ===\nLonely, Galactus created a being in his own image; however, while Galactus was content to survive, his creation craved conquest. The creation, becoming known as [[Tyrant]], battled his creator in a struggle beyond description. Galactus eventually triumphed, possibly aided by the Spinsterhood order of women warriors, banishing Tyrant to parts unknown. Since then, Galactus has used many mindless servants, chief among which are the [[Punisher (robot)|Punishers]], possibly living beings enslaved or created by Galactus. Eventually, the world-devourer realized it was more efficient to send a herald to seek out worlds for him. His first herald was eventually cast out and imprisoned, presumably due to its corrupt and violent nature. This former herald, the [[Fallen One (unrevealed)|Fallen One]], escaped many times over the millennia, each time heading directly after its previous master, who always defeated it. \n\n=== Rise of the Silver Surfer ===\n[[image: galactus01.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]\nGalactus threatened to devour the planet [[Zenn-La]], but was persuaded by native Norrin Radd to spare it in exchange for becoming a new herald. Galactus transformed Radd into the [[Silver Surfer]], suppressing his morals so that he would lead Galactus to inhabited worlds when necessary, such as the planet of the symbiotes and the [[Kree]] planet [[Tarsis]]. The Surfer once even led Galactus into ending the threat of the murderous warlord [[Kallreich the Unconquerable]] by consuming a world he had invaded. When the Silver Surfer brought Galactus to Earth, despite the efforts of [[Uatu The Watcher]] to hide the planet, [[Masters, Alicia|Alicia Masters]] reached Norrin's long-submerged emotions, convincing him to turn against his master. Galactus had easily overpowered the [[Fantastic Four]], but the Surfer's power delayed Galactus' meal long enough for [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] to present him with his first defeat. Uatu sent the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] to Galactus' worldship to retrieve the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], a device allegedly having the power to destroy even mighty Galactus; Reed used it to force him to spare Earth, but Galactus punished the Surfer for his betrayal by trapping him on Earth. \n\nSoon after, Galactus sensed abundant energy sources within the enigmatic [[Black Galaxy]], but Galactus was distracted when [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Dr. Doom]] usurped the Silver Surfer's power and crashed into Galactus' barrier; sensing this disturbance, Galactus scanned Doom, but found him beneath his notice and sent him back to [[Latveria]]. Galactus soon sent his Punisher to retrieve the Surfer from Earth; the Fantastic Four held it off long enough for the Surfer to escape into the [[Glossary:M#microverse|microverse]]. Galactus forced them to help him find the Surfer, who located an uninhabited planet for him, after which he left the Surfer trapped on Earth for easy future location.\n\n=== New Heralds and Defeated Hunger ===\nConsuming the world [[Taur]] to replenish his stores, Galactus journeyed into the Black Galaxy, where he encountered [[Ego|Ego The Living Planet]]. With the aid of [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]], recruited by the Colonizers of Rigel, Ego drove off Galactus; the surviving Archeopians made Ego their new home. Galactus was targeted by Dr. Doom, who used the reality-altering [[Cosmic Cube]] and other weapons to steal Galactus' power, but he retook the power with the aid of the Fantastic Four. Seeking a new herald, Galactus transformed Gabriel Lan, captain of the [[Xandar]]ian starship ''Way-Opener'', into the [[Air-Walker (Gabriel Lan)|Air-Walker]], but he was subsequently slain defending his master from the alien [[Ovoids]]. Galactus transferred Lan's life-spark into an Air-Walker robot and followed it to Earth, where it was destroyed by the Fantastic Four. Galactus then forced the Surfer to agree to follow him anywhere in the universe, but Reed Richards altered Galactus' ship controls, sending him into the [[Negative Zone]], beyond the scope of the Surfer's promise.\n\n=== More Betrayal, More Strife ===\nReturning to the Earth dimension, Galactus empowered Lan's former first officer Pyreus Kril as his new herald, [[Firelord (Pyreus Kril)|Firelord]]. He sent Kril to recruit Thor's aid against the now-maddened Ego, who had consumed the Archeopians. Thor freed Firelord from Galactus' servitude by offering the Asgardian [[Destroyer (construct)|Destroyer]] construct in his place. The Destroyer led Galactus to the [[High Evolutionary|High Evolutionary's]] [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]], and the Evolutionary summoned the Fantastic Four for aid. Though the heroes' efforts to find unpopulated worlds found only the robot-world [[Mekka]] and one of the [[Skrulls|Skrullian]] Kral worlds, the [[Impossible Man]] offered his own planet, [[Poppup]], whose people suffered from terminal boredom. Consuming Poppup, Galactus faded from existence due to cosmic indigestion. During Galactus' absence, his ship was invaded by the god [[Loki]], who stole the Destroyer, and also by the time-traveling [[Korvac]], who absorbed immense power and plotted to conquer the universe. Upon re-forming, Galactus realized what had happened and turned the Ultimate Nullifier against Korvac, who feigned death to escape. Reed Richards then summoned Galactus to Earth to defeat the power of the [[Sphinx (Anath-Na Mut)|Sphinx]]. In exchange, the Fantastic Four found a replacement herald; per Galactus' requirements, one not so concerned about innocent lives. From the planet [[Lanlak]], the Four recruited its lord, Tyros, whom Galactus transformed into [[Terrax]] the Tamer. \n\n=== Double Crossed and Near Death ===\n[[image: galactus02.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]However, Terrax proved disloyal; after locating a number of planets, Terrax tried to claim a new empire for himself. When Galactus tried to recall him, Terrax fled into a black hole. In response, Galactus' drone [[R-11]] recruited the [[Dazzler (Alison Blaire)|Dazzler]], who recovered Terrax after Galactus briefly imbued her with power cosmic. Resuming his duties, Terrax led the planet-eater to [[Galador]], where Galactus slew that world's [[Prime Director]] and the warrior [[Terminator]] before the Spaceknight ROM convinced Galactus to instead seek out [[Wraithworld]], the home of Galador's [[Dire Wraiths|Dire Wraith]] enemies. The magic of Wraithworld and its Dark Nebula proved too much for Galactus, but he nonetheless honored his agreement to spare Galador, though he transported it to a distant location unknown to the Spaceknights. Terrax next led Galactus back to Earth, hoping the Fantastic Four could again defeat him, but Galactus stripped Terrax of his power and cast him out. The Fantastic Four, [[Avengers]], and [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Dr. Strange]] defeated the exhausted Galactus, but as the world devourer lay dying, Reed organized efforts to save him. Galactus nonetheless needed to feed, but instead accepted the Human Torch Frankie Raye's offer to become his new herald, transforming her into [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]]. \n\n=== A Great Feast ===\nNova initially led Galactus to populated worlds, including Kehil, the surviving natives of which she later found a new home. When Galactus' life force had ebbed so low that he was visited by Death itself, Nova led him to feed on [[Tarnax IV]], the Skrull Throneworld, an act which threw the Skrull empire into chaos; a group of time-traveling [[X-Men]] narrowly escaped Tarnax IV in time. Shortly thereafter, Reed Richards was tried by an intergalactic group for his crime of saving Galactus, but was acquitted after Galactus himself appeared, and his ties to the life of the universe were revealed by Eternity; though the specific memory quickly faded from those present, the sense that Galactus had a specific purpose in the universe was retained. \n\n=== Against All Odds ===\nSoon after, Galactus was transported to the artificially created [[Battleworld]] by the [[Beyonder]] to serve in his \"[[Secret Wars]]\". Galactus instead attempted to devour Battleworld, but Dr. Doom briefly usurped his power once more. Shortly after revoking the Silver Surfer's exile on Earth, Galactus was assaulted by the [[Elders of the Universe]], who sought to destroy him and the universe, and be reborn in the next universe as Galactus had been. The Surfer and Nova helped Galactus defeat their plots, which included battles with Ego and the cosmic [[In-Betweener]], and a trip into a black hole, after which Galactus replenished himself on the populated world [[Naja-7]]. After assisting [[Power Pack]] in curing a maddened Nova, Galactus was drawn back to Earth by the power of the Phoenix Force, briefly battling its then-host, [[Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers)|Rachel Summers]], before acknowledging the Force as essential to the universe.\n\n=== Drawn Into War ===\n[[image: galactus04.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]Galactus was again summoned to Earth to defeat a deadly threat, the [[Consortium]], and was banished to the inter-dimensional world [[Quwrll]]. After his return, the Surfer warned Galactus of the mad Titan [[Thanos]], made virtually omnipotent by the [[Infinity Gems]]. Galactus scoffed at this threat until Thanos mocked him by eliminating a planet upon which Galactus had intended to feed. Ironically enough, Galactus was also taunted by the [[Deviants|Deviant]]-[[Inhumans|Inhuman]] hybrid [[Maelstrom]], who had acquired vast power as well, though he was soon destroyed by a black hole of his own making. After consuming another planet, Galactus joined a number of cosmic entities in opposing Thanos and then the space-pirate [[Nebula]] (who took the gems from Thanos), but even mighty Galactus was of little weight against the Infinity Gems. Galactus joined the other cosmic beings in deciding that the hero Adam Warlock was not worthy to hold the collective Gems, as well as investigating the threat of the cosmically powered [[Edifice Rex]], who sought to clean up the universe.\n\nShortly thereafter, Galactus, Nova, Dr. Strange, and the Surfer investigated the powerful energies harnessed by [[Warlock, Adam|Warlock's]] dark counterpart, the [[Magus (Adam Warlock)|Magus]]. In the process, he encountered the mystic entity [[Agamotto]] and the extra-dimensional exile, [[Khoon]] the Explorer. The Magus utilized five reality-altering Cosmic Containment Units, dwarfing Galactus' power; Galactus convinced the god-like [[Living Tribunal]] to allow the Infinity Gems to be used collectively again, playing directly into the hands of the Magus, who usurped the Gems and added them to his power. Galactus saved the lives of the heroes opposing the Magus, while Warlock facilitated the Magus' banishment to the realm within the Infinity Soul Gem.\n\n=== Sympathy and Greed ===\nNova grew close to Galactus, even becoming privy to his emotions and private thoughts; but Galactus dismissed her when she resisted the idea of leading him to inhabited worlds. Galactus then empowered the blood-thirsty [[Morg]] as his new herald, but Morg's lust for power led past heralds to war against him. Nova apparently died at Morg's hands, and after the other heralds slew Morg, Galactus accepted both the Firelord and the restored Air-Walker android as heralds while he secretly resurrected Morg, this time keeping him more manageable; however, Morg was soon abducted by Galactus' old rival, Tyrant, who sought to challenge his creator again. Unwilling to risk battle with Tyrant at the time, Galactus reluctantly allowed Tyrant to retain Morg in exchange for a temporary truce. Morg later escaped and returned to Galactus, and only the Surfer saved the other two heralds from his wrath. When Tyrant confronted Galactus and managed to overpower him, Morg discharged the Ultimate Nullifier in an effort to stop Tyrant, but also apparently destroyed himself and Galactus. \n\nGalactus survived by escaping extra-dimensionally and was later summoned by Reed to oppose the power of [[Hyperstorm]]; the two beings were drawn back to the dimensional void. Later, Galactus sent the Surfer after a power object, which proved to be an ancient demon. Galactus testified before Roma on the Fantastic Four's ability to safely watch over [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin Richards]], after which he consumed one of the [[Collector|Collector's]] specimen worlds, which had been unwittingly exposed to him by [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]]. Galactus next located an extra-dimensional gladiator whom he had been tracking for decades, transforming him into his herald, until he was liberated by the Fantastic Four.\n\n=== Consumed by Hunger ===\nGalactus' hunger grew greater than ever, driving him mad with desire to consume sentient life. Recruiting a new herald, [[Red Shift]], Galactus devoured world after world, including [[Verdant]], until a union of Earth's heroes and the armies of several races, including the [[Kree]] and [[Shi'ar]], mounted an offensive against him. Ultimately the Surfer turned Galactus' own ship against him, and it consumed his form, dispersing him into inert energy. One of Galactus' old enemies, [[Abraxas]], now left without anyone to hold him in check, threatened to destroy a number of realities, including [[Earth-616]] (mainstream Earth). Franklin Richards and Marvel Girl (the future [[Richards, Valeria|Valeria Richards]]) combined their reality-altering powers to re-form Galactus, who then directed the Ultimate Nullifier's destruction of Abraxas, restoring the universes. \n\nAfter again opposing Thanos (then powered by the [[Heart of the Infinite]]), Galactus fell prey to a near-fatal deception. The extra-dimensional [[Hunger (extradimensional)|Hunger]], who consumed universes as Galactus consumed worlds, duped the planet-eater into believing that he could use the Infinity Gems to forever end his appetite; however, the device he constructed instead formed a portal that allowed Hunger entry into his universe. This time it was Thanos who saved all of existence, seemingly destroying Hunger. As a weakened Galactus recovered, the Fallen One again escaped and pursued him, but was defeated by Thanos and the diminutive powerhouse [[Skreet]]. During the event known as the [[Annihilation]], the world devourer was sought out by the remaining [[Proemial Gods]], [[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis]] and [[Tenebrous]] for his atrocities against there brethren. Still in a weakened state from his encounters with Hunger, Thanos and the Fallen One, Galactus along with the Silver Surfer, was easily defeated by the Proemial Gods and handed over to [[Annihilus]]. While holding Galactus in captivity, Annihilus persuaded Thanos to find a way to harness his mighty “power cosmic” to use the world devourer as a cosmic cannon. Galactus would eventually freed by the actions of [[Drax|Drax the Destroyer]].  Soon after, Galactus was assaulted by yet another extra-dimensional powerhouse who sought the origins of the universe, but he recovered via the actions of the Avengers and a league of heroes from another reality. \n\n=== The Survivors Rebel, The Torch Transformed ===\n[[image: galactus03.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]A group of survivors of Galactus' predations discovered a means to shield worlds from him, but learned that a power on Earth could overcome this technology. [[Zius]] led the survivors to Earth to prevent Galactus from obtaining this power: the [[Invisible Woman]]. Reed Richards switched the powers of the Invisible Woman with the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]], deceiving Zius into believing he had neutralized her power; however, Galactus arrived almost immediately afterwards and claimed Johnny as his new herald, amplifying his powers via the power cosmic. While pretending to fulfill his mission, Johnny sought to rally other worlds against Galactus, ultimately delaying him until the Fantastic Four and [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] could arrive to help. Johnny's new powers allowed him to analyze Galactus' nature, and he instructed Reed and Quasar to form a device that temporarily transformed Galactus back to the powerless Galan. Brought to Manhattan while Reed raced to find an alternate energy source for him, Galan was impressed with humanity's indomitable will and constant struggle against hardship, and he chose to exile himself extra-dimensionally rather than risk destroying it all when his power returned.\n\n=== Back to Basics ===\nApparently reverting to his old ways upon regaining his power, Galactus returned and recruited a new herald, [[Stardust]], who worshipped his master and believed others should submit to him. Galactus then consumed the second home of the Korbinite race, though the people's life forces were preserved in a Meta-Orb. When their protector, [[Beta Ray Bill]], fought Stardust, the herald unwittingly opened a dimensional warp that unleashed the monstrous Astoreth, who threatened to consume the entire universe. While Bill joined forces with Stardust against her, Galactus empowered Bill's predecessor, [[Alpha Ray Bill]], who sacrificed himself and Stardust in the process of driving Astoreth into a black hole.\n\nBeyond good and evil, forced to destroy entire worlds to survive, Galactus is intimately tied to the nature of the universe. He believes it is his destiny to ultimately give back to the universe much more than he has taken. He currently has two heralds, Silver Surfer, and Stardust.\n\n*Note: The Surfer once believed the enigmatic cosmic [[Other]] had consumed Zenn-La shortly after his departure and that Zenn-La's existence was a mere illusion maintained by Galactus. However, numerous interactions of [[Shalla-Bal]] and other Zenn-Lavians with the people of Earth and other races would seem to refute this. The truth remains uncertain.\n\n*Note: Although Galactus is usually represented in humanoid form, each sentient being perceives him having a form resembling that of his own race; humans see him as humanoid and Skrulls as Skrullian.",

Mephisto failed to corrupt Noble at this time, but he kept track of the Kale clan from then on, watching as Noble manifested in the firstborn of every generation.\n\n==Enter John Blaze==\nJohn Blaze was born into a world of motorcycle grease and cheering crowds. The son of [[Blaze, Barton|Barton Blaze]] and [[Kale, Naomi|Naomi Kale]], Johnny spent his early years in the [[Quentin Carnival]], where his parents starred in a stunt show with [[Simpson, Craig|Craig \"Crash\" Simpson]]. His idyllic home life ended abruptly, however, when Naomi abandoned John, taking his younger siblings - [[Blaze, Barbara|Barbara]] and [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Daniel]] - with her. Naomi's decision to leave had been difficult, but she felt it was necessary because of the family curse. She feared that her own firstborn would suffer in the same way that she had, so she left him behind and placed her other children in the care of a woman named [[Ketch, Francis|Francis Ketch]]. \n\nThe pain of losing his mother caused John to repress many of his memories of Naomi and his siblings. When Barton died in a stunt shortly thereafter, John was adopted by Crash and [[Simpson, Mona|Mona Simpson]], who helped fabricate a past for Johnny, one that they hoped would be less painful than the truth. Believing that his real mother - \"Clara Blaze\" - had passed away, Johnny became an enthusiastic member of the Simpson clan, growing close to their daughter, [[Black Rose|Roxanne]]. The two became inseparable and, as they grew older, their love for one another moved beyond familial. \n\nNaomi Kale returned to spy on John; while glad to see him grow into a happy young man, she still feared he might eventually succumb to the family curse. Naomi bargained with Mephisto to spare John, hoping this might end the curse. Unfortunately, Mephisto betrayed her in the final moments of her life, swearing that even though Johnny would not become the true Ghost Rider, he still could become \"a\" Ghost Rider. \n\nUnaware of the mystical forces swirling around him, John followed the Simpsons into their own traveling stunt show - the Crash Simpson Stunt Cycle Extravaganza. Crash had become a true father figure to Johnny by this time, teaching him how to ride in the hopes that the younger man might eventually succeed him as the star of the show. This dream came to a fiery end when Johnny was fifteen. While practicing a dangerous stunt, Johnny was nearly killed and Mona Simpson was mortally wounded. When Mona asked John on her deathbed to quit riding, he swore to her that he would. \n\n==Deal With the Devil==\nOver the next five years, Johnny's relationship with Crash deteriorated as John refused to take part in the show. Not understanding John's motivations, Crash grew increasingly frustrated, even accusing his adopted son of cowardice; however, John continued to practice at night, honing his skills until he surpassed his mentor. He had another secret, too: he and Roxanne had become lovers. When Crash revealed he was dying of cancer, he asked Johnny once more to take over the show, but Johnny refused despite Roxanne's disappointment. Distraught, John turned to the occult in search of answers. His studies ultimately led to a spell that supposedly could summon [[Satan (Marduk Kurios)|Satan]] himself. John didn't realize it, but the entity he summoned was actually the same Mephisto who had cheated Naomi Kale years before. Mephisto cured Crash of his cancer in return for Johnny's promise of servitude. Crash died almost immediately afterwards, however, in a failed attempt to set a world's record by jumping over 22 cars. Despairing over the loss of his adopted father, Johnny attempted - and made - the jump himself, seeking to honor Crash's memory. Johnny was still at Mephisto's mercy, though, and would have lost his soul outright if not for the heroic intervention of Roxanne, who proclaimed her love for Johnny and drove the demon away with the purity of her emotion (though Mephisto would return). \n\n[[image: skull.jpg|left|180px|thumb]]One night after Crash's death, Johnny found himself transformed into a skeletal being with a flaming skull. Fearing at first that this demonic form was a manifestation of his own evil side, he soon realized that he had bonded with some wholly separate entity. This merger of Johnny Blaze and a demonic force became known as the Ghost Rider, which amused Mephisto greatly. Transforming nightly into the Ghost Rider, John became involved with a local motorcycle gang, [[Satan's Servants]]. Their leader, Curly Samuels, had gained the Ghost Rider's trust, until a shocked John discovered that the soul of Crash Simpson lurked within Curly's form. Mephisto had offered Crash a new life in exchange for betraying his adopted son, and Crash had eagerly accepted. The Ghost Rider's spirit was cast into [[Hell]], where he managed to reawaken Crash's sense of honor and love. The older man sacrificed himself to help Johnny escape, making Ghost Rider promise to protect Roxanne. \n\nJohn and Roxanne then journeyed into the American Southwest, where Ghost Rider battled the Satanist known as [[Witch Woman]], Linda Littletrees. Remaining for a time near Copperhead Canyon, Ghost Rider also fought [[Hellstorm|Daimon Hellstrom]], the Son of Satan. This began a long period of roaming the West, as John sought to avoid Mephisto and protect Roxanne. While in San Francisco, Roxanne was tricked into renouncing her love for John, and Mephisto nearly claimed John's soul in full; however, a long-haired stranger saved the day, driving Mephisto away at the last minute. This bearded mystery man identified himself only as \"a friend\", and Blaze came to view him as a heavenly figure, offering hope and salvation. This stranger would appear several more times before finally being revealed as another falsehood of Mephisto.\n\nDiscouraged over the revelations about the \"friend\" and fearing his growing lack of control over the Ghost Rider, John left Roxanne and spent years wandering on his own. During this time, he teamed with the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Archangel|Angel]], [[Iceman]] and [[Hercules (Heracles)|Hercules]] to foil one of [[Pluto]]'s evil plots, and the five heroes founded the [[Champions (of Los Angeles)|Champions]]. Though billed as \"super heroes for the ordinary man\", the Champions were beset by internal tensions and never truly gelled as a team. After a few months, Ghost Rider realized that he was too much of a loner to remain with the group and he bid them farewell when the Champions disbanded. \n\nBy this time, the demonic half of the Ghost Rider was exerting more and more control over his actions and personality. John found it increasingly difficult to continue his stunt rider career, surrendering the title of World Champion Stunt Rider after losing a series of grueling challenges to [[Fargo, Flagg|Flagg Fargo]]. A demoralized John found a sense of peace by joining the Quentin Carnival, a place he did not remember from his childhood, but which nevertheless felt like home. Blaze forged a friendly rivalry with fellow rider [[Fowler, Red|Red Fowler]] and engaged in harmless flirtation with [[Randolph, Cynthia|Cynthia Randolph]], a journalist for Woman magazine assigned to follow the Carnival. While traveling with the Carnival, John also ran afoul of the mad [[Centurious]], who fed off imprisoned souls using an ancient artifact called the [[Crystal of Souls]]; this encounter stirred dark memories in the Ghost Rider. Shortly thereafter, the demonic [[Nightmare]] captured John and revealed the name of the demon within Blaze: Zarathos. \n\nBlaze and Zarathos continued to struggle with each other for dominance until Roxanne Simpson returned, seeking aid for a town overrun by Centurious and his agent, the [[Sin-Eater (Ethan Domblue)]]. Ghost Rider clashed once more with Centurious, learning that he and Zarathos had a feud going back centuries. In the end, Zarathos and Centurious were bound within the Crystal of Souls and John Blaze was free at last. With a gracious donation from his old friend the Angel, John was able to purchase the Carnival and marry Roxanne, with whom he had two children, [[Blaze, Craig|Craig]] and [[Blaze, Emma|Emma]]. \n\n==Ghost Riders Expand==\nYears later, John heard about a new [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] in New York. Fearing Zarathos was free, Blaze captured the Dan Ketch Ghost Rider, but soon realized the entity within Dan was not Zarathos. During their clash, a burst of Ghost Rider's Hellfire was conducted through Blaze's shotgun into John himself, who discovered he could now discharge Hellfire from the weapon. Armed with this shotgun and a mystical motorcycle, John became a mentor of sorts to the new Ghost Rider, trying to guard Dan against evil forces. \n\nAgainst his wife's wishes, John was immersed in the supernatural again. When he allied himself with the [[Midnight Sons]] against [[Lilith (Mother Of Demons)|Lilith]], Mother of Demons, the Carnival became a target for John's enemies. It was attacked by [[Vengeance]], who blamed John for having ruined his father's career. John and the Midnight Sons later thwarted an alliance between Centurious and Lilith, though their schemes led to the return of Zarathos. When Centurious's agent [[Carver (unrevealed)|Carver]] tried to remove a Medallion of Power fragment from Blaze by slashing him, Blaze's wounds burnt with Hellfire, and he was encased in a cybernetic shell to save his life. Shortly thereafter, the Blood known as [[Caretaker (Unrevealed)|Caretaker]] revealed that John and Dan were brothers, strengthening their bond further. Together, they helped destroy Zarathos' physical form, though Dan was temporarily lost. \n\n[[image: ghostrider03.jpg|left|220px|thumb]]While one side of John's family grew closer, the other began coming apart. When Emma and Craig were kidnapped by rogue Blood member [[Regent]], John rescued them, but was shocked to learn that Roxanne had bargained the children away years earlier in hopes that Regent could remove the Kale curse. John and Roxanne were just moving past this painful revelation when she was killed by [[Hellgate, Anton|Anton Hellgate]], one of Ketch's foes, and their children were kidnapped again. After slaying Centurious, Blaze swore on Roxanne's grave that he would rebuild the Carnival and find their children. After shedding his cybernetic shell, Blaze confronted undead serial killer [[Icebox Bob]], who revealed that the kids were being held by the Mesopotamian god-turned-demon [[Ba'al (Ba'al Hadad)|Ba'al]]. In a dimension-spanning adventure involving the mystic Wendigo spirit and the angelic [[Uri-El]], Blaze was reunited with his children; but within months, the children went missing yet again. While helping Dan Ketch learn the full origins of his Ghost Rider spirit, John discovered that the sorceress [[Kale, Jennifer|Jennifer Kale]] was their cousin. She helped Blaze seek his missing children, but they were ultimately forced to admit defeat, calling off the search. During this time, Roxanne was revived as a demonic servant of [[Blackheart]]'s, bearing the name Black Rose. Though she had no memory of her past self initially, Noble Kale restored her memories during his time as Ruler of Hell. Apparently feeling that John had moved on, Roxanne decided to let John continue believing that she was dead.\n\nStarting over, John found a new job as an accountant and a new girlfriend, Chloe; but he was still linked to Zarathos, and the demon began to reconstitute within him. Regularly transforming into Ghost Rider again, John quit his job and hit the road. However, the reborn Ghost Rider's personality was different than before, less talkative and more indifferent to the welfare of innocent bystanders. Desperate to escape this renewed curse, John hired mercenary [[Gunmetal Gray]] to kill Ghost Rider, whom Gray pursued with malicious glee. Finally cornered at the Sturgis biker convention, John Blaze and Zarathos seemed to make peace with one another and merged in a new way, defeating Gray. Ghost Rider rode off into the sunset, seeking more innocents to avenge.\n\n== Vicious Cycle ==\n\nGhost Rider was eventually cast back into Hell where [[Lucifer (Prince of Darkness)|Lucifer]] plotted to allow Blaze to escape and unknowingly pull the devil out into the mortal world with him. Once there, Lucifer's body was separated into 666 pieces, and those slivers of his essence would reanimate random corpses of the recently deceased. Each time Ghost Rider destroyed one avatar, its power would be divided to the rest. It was Lucifer's hope that Blaze would destroy every piece of him until only one remained with enough power to bring Hell to [[Earth]].  Ghost Rider, during his hunt, encountered others such as [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]] and [[Numecet]] that warned him of the consequences should Lucifer become whole again, but Ghost Rider was determined to kill every tainted piece of his tormentor. Blaze even found himself in Sleepy Hollow, Illinois fighting Lucifer in the form of a deceased [[Jack O'Lantern (Steven Levins)|Jack O' Lantern]]. After defeating Lucifer and his zombie army, with the help of a local sheriff, Blaze forced the Ghost Rider entity to go to New York and help the other heroes oppose the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] during the [[World War Hulk|war he waged in Manhattan]]. With Blaze in control, the Hulk had no trouble defending himself, but once Ghost Rider exerted his control over Blaze, the Hulk almost a fight on his hands. However, Ghost Rider only avenges the innocent, and he did not deem the members of the [[Illuminati]] blameless for what they did to the Hulk. Ghost Rider left Manhattan immediately and resumed his search for the last remaining avatars of Lucifer. Blaze eventually did what he said he would and drove the devil back to Hell, but the effort cost him the life of a friend and lover in the form of a trucker named [[Dixie]]. \n\n== Revelations ==\n\nJust because Lucifer was conquered, it didn't mean life would get any easier for Ghost Rider. With the devil's defeat, came the revelation of who was really behind Blaze’s suffering. The devil had help in the form of an angel – a rogue angel by the name of [[Zadkiel]]. Zadkiel and his minions waged war in [[Heaven]] because Zadkiel thought he could prevail where Lucifer had lost. Only thing was Zadkiel bonded Heaven’s greatest weapon to the soul of Johnny Blaze which also became Johnny’s curse. Now Blaze is on a mission to hunt an angel, and pay him back for ruining his life. Ghost Rider’s hunt for Zadkiel brought him to a place in Montana called New Beulah where Zadkiel's earthly servants, the [[Cycle Nurses]] almost put a premature end to the Spirit of Vengeance’s plans. Not only that, but a horde of [[Ghosts of Highway 18|flesh eating ghosts]] almost made a meal out of Blaze, but nothing would deter him from his goal. Ghost Rider did away with both threats, but he didn’t know about the one person from his past that would come back into his life as a possible enemy – Daniel Ketch, the other Ghost Rider. Johnny then broke into a maximum security penitentiary where he thought he could find answers on how to make it to Heaven to face Zadkiel, but all Ghost Rider found was another enemy in the form of the [[Deacon]]. Although quite formidable, the Deacon was defeated, but Blaze wasn’t out of the woods yet. He was closer to Zadkiel than he’d been before, but now he would have to get through his brother, Daniel, to get to the rogue angel.\n\n== Last Stand of the Spirits of Vengeance ==\n\nDaniel Ketch, a former Ghost Rider on the right side of justice, was now a servant of Zadkiel's, and he was hunting other Spirits of Vengeance throughout the world. He was hunting and killing them, so Zadkiel could have their power as his own. Ketch even  allied himself with Ghost Rider’s enemies. Blackout, [[Death Ninja]], [[Doghead]] and the [[Orb]] paid Caretaker a visit with a tragic ending. Caretaker was killed, but his granddaughter, [[Caretaker (Sara)|Sara]] took his place as the new Caretaker. Blaze eventually caught up with Daniel in Tibet, but not before Ketch could take the life of another [[Ghost Rider (Nima)|Ghost Rider]]. Blaze confronted Daniel, and the resulting fight left Blaze begging Danny to end his burden and take away the curse of the Ghost Rider. Much to Daniel's frustration, Sara would not let this happen. Wallowing in self-pity, Blaze began to think Daniel was right in his actions. However, two more Spirits of Vengeance, [[Ghost Rider (Molek)|Molek]] and [[Ghost Rider (Bai Gu Jing)|Bai Gu Jing]], came to Blaze and forced him to take a trip with them. The first stop was Tokyo, Japan where another Ghost Rider, [[Ghost Rider (Yoshio Kannabe)|Yoshio Kannabe]] was stationed. The group arrived too late to help their mystical brother-in-arms, however, for they found Yoshio terrified and defeated, the Ghost Rider entity no longer within his body. Blaze then accompanied his associates to the Congo where [[Ghost Rider (Baron Skullfire)|Baron Skullfire]] and [[Ghost Rider (Marinette Bwa Chech)|Marinette Bwa Chech]] were waiting. These were the last two remaining Ghost Riders, and they were eager to bring Zadkiel to his knees. Unfortunately, Ketch and the [[Black Host]] proved to be too strong for even their combined might. Ketch stole all the Ghost Rider powers from everyone, including Blaze, and delivered them to his master. Zadkiel revealed he was playing Ketch for a fool and cast him out of Heaven, so Daniel took back as much power as he could - keeping some for himself and giving some back to Blaze. Sara and Blaze went their separate ways, and Blaze all but gave up on himself and Heaven. His travels led him to a small town under siege by a demon calling herself the [[Skin-Bender]]. Blaze was immune to her maniacal manipulations because of the power of the Ghost Rider, and once unleashed, the Skin-Bender didn't stand a chance. Ghost Rider defeated the monster and reunited with Sara. Blaze had to be reminded where the souls of his deceased children were before he decided to renew his war with Zadkiel and retake Heaven.\n\n== Heaven's On Fire ==\n\nBlaze's search for Zadkiel took him and Sara all across the country. Finally, a piece of the puzzle was revealed to him – Zadkiel was going to kill the [[Kid Blackheart|Antichrist]]. Usually one step behind the son of [[Satan (disambiguation)|Satan]], Blaze finally caught up to him in New York. He was nearly killed by the minions of Zadkiel, but [[Cutter, Jaine|Jaine Cutter]], and a hesitant [[Hellstorm]], rescued him. The Antichrist attempted to escape his protectors, but Daniel Ketch caught him and brought him back to the others. Ketch explained he made a deal with the devil to keep his son safe in exchange for the keys to Heaven. All were reluctant but realized they had no choice but to work with each other. Splitting up, Blaze and Ketch were attacked by [[Big Wheel]] and [[Trull|Trull, the Mighty]] while Jaine and Hellstorm had to deal with [[Madcap]] and [[Scarecrow (Ebenezer Laughton)|Scarecrow]], leaving Sara alone with the Antichrist. Trull got stomped and Big Wheel received the Penance Stare, but when the Ghost Riders reached a gateway to Heaven, the key was nowhere to be found. The two brothers pressed on to find another doorway, unaware the Antichrist had one with him all along – Sara, the new Caretaker. Blaze and Ketch found the lair of the [[Gun Nuns]], but once they arrived they were thrown into battle with the [[Orb]] and the new [[Vengeance (Kowalski)|Vengeance]]. After the battle was finished, the Ghost Riders were permitted to enter Heaven, and Johnny Blaze and Daniel Ketch finally stood face-to-face with their tormentor, Zadkiel. Their confrontation was quick and furious, leaving the Spirits of Vengeance defeated. Blaze, ready to give up hope, was encouraged by the souls of his wife and children to stand up to Zadkiel again and told him there were others willing to help. Blaze led Danny and an army of Ghost Riders to finish Zadkiel and his Black Host. Old allies as well as others long thought dead – such as [[Ghost Rider (Ghost Flyer)|Ghost Flyer]], [[Ghost Rider (Undead G-Man)|Undead G-Man]] and [[Ghost Rider (Knuckles O'Shaugnessy)|Knuckles O'Shaugnessy]], [[Ghost Rider (Devil Rig)|Devil Rig]] and his partner [[Ghost Rider (Hell-Driver)|Hell-Driver]] – were anxious to deliver vengeance on the evil which inhabited Heaven. Zadkiel was bested, but the Antichrist used Sara to gain entry into Heaven, and he brought numerous demons with him. To his surprise, the Ghost Riders were ready, and each and every vile creature was put down, to the cry of, \"Bring it on, you sumbitches!\" by one unidentified [[Ghost Rider (Unidentified)|Ghost Rider]]. Heaven was safe in God's hands once more and Blaze and Ketch were returned to Earth. Sara, after gaining some vengeance of her own, rejoined them, and the three rode off into the sunset.",

However, Clint severely injured one of Marko's guards and discovered him to be his brother, Barney. Repelled by the consequences of his actions (and his mentor's role in prompting them), he abandoned Trickshot and parted on bad terms. \n\nHis natural archery abilities honed to an expert level, Clint wandered the country, working in various carnivals or otherwise making money out of the costume and persona of \"Hawkeye\". One day, when witnessing [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] save the lives of some people at the carnival, he decided to become a costumed crime-fighter himself. But as luck would have it, on Hawkeye's first night on patrol, he was mistaken for a criminal by the police and hunted down. \n\n[[image: hawkeye01.jpg|left|thumb|200px]]He soon met the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], who was working at the time as a costumed villain for her country, and she easily seduced the hot-headed adventurer, making him think it was in his interest to defeat Iron Man. He attempted to do so according to her prompting on several occasions, but soon wised up, regretting his decision. Instead, he hoped to join Iron Man's team of [[Avengers]]. As a way of proving himself, he broke into the [[Avengers Mansion]] and convinced their butler, [[Jarvis, Edwin|Jarvis]], to play the role of a victim so he could display his powers. Iron Man vouched for Hawkeye, and he joined the new line-up that included [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], the [[Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff)|Scarlet Witch]], and [[Quicksilver]]. \n\nClint continued to be an active member of the Avengers for years, with his archery skills matching the superhuman powers of his teammates. His brash attitude initially chafed under the leadership of Captain America, and, although it took some time to come to respect him, the two have become good friends. Also at first, he felt attracted the Scarlet Witch, even to the point of having trouble getting over her eventual marriage to the [[Vision]]. For years, he also continued to hold a torch for the Black Widow, until she returned to her espionage career and told him that she had never loved him (although she said that in order to keep him away.)    \n\nHawkeye stayed with the Avengers for a long time, leaving only briefly when his temper and ego led him to believe he wasn't wanted. He returned after a short period, having joined the \"non-team\" [[Defenders]] in the meantime. At one point, Hawkeye was passed over accompanying the Avengers in the [[Kree-Skrull War]] due to his lack of superhuman abilities. Not one to be deterred so easily, Hawkeye took on the identity of Goliath with the use of [[Yellowjacket (Henry Pym)|Hank Pym]]'s size-altering particles. He hitched a ride so as to join the team in their intergalactic adventure and maintained the Goliath identity for several months upon their return to Earth. \n\nDuring his time as Goliath, Clint was approached by his brother, who had become a big-time racketeer. Barney had learned of [[Egghead]]'s plans to construct an orbiting laser death-ray to extort money from the United States and came to the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Egghead and his allies, the [[Mad Thinker]] and the [[Puppet Master]], but tragically, Barney died in the ensuing battle. Later, Egghead would use the Swordsman to capture Clint as Goliath, thinking him to be Hank Pym, but Hawkeye-as-Goliath soon defeated both criminals, avenging his brother at last. Soon afterward, Clint abandoned the Goliath identity but continued to serve the Avengers as Hawkeye the Marksman.\n\nAnother leave of absence was forced upon him, when, due to a type of \"affirmative action\", he was replaced by the [[Falcon (Sam Wilson)|Falcon]] to comply with the Avengers' government sanction. During this time, he eventually found employment as a night security guard for Cross Technological Enterprises (CTE). Never gone from his team for long, he soon rejoined the fold, although one particular solo adventure would have a lasting impact. His boss, head of CTE, was the villain known as [[Crossfire]] and hoped to test his ultrasonic equipment with which he hoped to turn heroes against one another, With the help of the ex-secret agent, [[Mockingbird]], Hawkeye defeated Crossfire. The two heroes, head over heels in love, promptly got married. \n\nAt the time, the Vision was expanding the Avengers' operations, and he named Hawkeye chairman of a [[Avengers West Coast|west coast branch]] of Avengers, and Mockingbird joined him as a charter member. Hawkeye led the team through several adventures, growing into a competent leader, and he even had time to embark on a series of solo adventures. During one of these latter adventures, Hawkeye had to defend himself against many costumed mercenaries and villains hoping to collect a bounty placed on his right arm. The mastermind behind it all proved to be Trickshot, now dying of cancer, and he was hoping to goad Hawkeye into killing him. Instead, Hawkeye reconciled with his former mentor and friend. \n\nDuring an adventure where the team became lost in the past, his wife was involved with the death of the Old West hero, the [[Phantom Rider (Lincoln Slade)|Phantom Rider]], and the situation caused the couple to split up. Shortly after, the government forced the membership of the [[U.S.Agent]] on the team, and Hawkeye quit. Both he and Mockingbird wound up investigating and leading the heroes known as the [[Great Lakes Avengers]]. Eventually, however, Hawkeye left the Midwest to rejoin the Avengers West Coast, although he never really led the team again.\n\n[[Image:Hawkeye.jpg|left|200px]] Hawkeye continued to adventure with the team, even alongside his separated wife, and was present with them when Mockingbird was killed in a demonic dimension, saving her husband's life from an attack by [[Mephisto]]. Distraught, Hawkeye left the team and took a cross-country walkabout. Later, Clint was commissioned to train a group of rebels known as the [[Shadows]] along with [[Sundance]] and [[Striker]]. He attempted to keep them from killing, but on one raid Striker killed a woman and injured her fiancé, a friend of [[Rhodes, James|James Rhodes]]. As War Machine, Rhodes was surprised to see Hawkeye among the rebels, and even more so when a government backed group led by the U.S.Agent also arrived. The three were able to stop the conflict and were confronted by the mysterious [[Advisor]].\nEventually drawn back to the Avengers' fold when the team was attacked in a [[Crossing|plan]] orchestrated by [[Immortus]], Hawkeye was present with the team when they apparently died, sacrificing themselves to absorb the energies of [[Onslaught (entity)|Onslaught]]. Eventually, Hawkeye and the other heroes were restored, and Hawkeye quickly rejoined the reforming Avengers.\n\nHowever, Hawkeye was dissatisfied. His previous experience as a team leader left him feeling too anxious as a regular member. Hawkeye turned his attention instead to the team of reforming villains, the [[Thunderbolts]]. Sympathetic because of his own outlaw past and eager for new challenges, Hawkeye offered to serve as the Thunderbolts' new leader if they would continue fighting crime and remain reformed. During his stint as their leader, he became a friend and mentor to the group, honing their skills and greatly enhancing their reputations. He and his teammate [[Moonstone (Karla Sofen)|Moonstone]] had even began developing romantic inclinations. The Thunderbolts soon became trusted allies of the Avengers, though Hawkeye formally resigned his membership in the latter group since he didn't want any perceived criminal association with the Thunderbolts to negatively impact the Avengers.\n\nUnfortunately, CSA agent and former Avengers government liaison [[Gyrich, Henry Peter|Henry Peter Gyrich]] targeted the Thunderbolts for assassination as part of a larger scheme to eradicate superhumans. Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts exposed and thwarted Gyrich's conspiracy, freeing Gyrich himself from the mind-controlling technology [[Baron Strucker]] had used to make Gyrich act out his anti-superhuman fantasies. Hawkeye agreed to keep the entire affair a secret in exchange for a full federal pardon for the other Thunderbolts, but a bitterly furious Gyrich refused to go along with concealing the incident unless Hawkeye went to prison for operating as an illegal vigilante with the Thunderbolts. Hawkeye agreed and was remanded to federal custody.\n\n[[image: hawkeye02.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]While in Seagate Federal Penitentiary, Barton was contacted telepathically by [[Mentallo]], who orchestrated a break-out for Hawkeye and three others (one of which was a Mentallo-possessed [[Headlok]]). Despite their success, the inmates remained remotely \"chained\" to each other. The so-called “Chain Gang” reluctantly agreed to work together to search for a way to survive, deactivate their security manacles, and to search for a weapon of great power left behind by the death of the criminal industrialist [[Hammer, Justin|Justin Hammer]]. Unknown to his associates, Barton was actually working undercover on behalf of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who hoped to use Barton as a mole to track Mentallo's criminal activities. S.H.I.E.L.D. also hired the Thunderbolts' [[Songbird]], who tracked Hawkeye and defeated his erstwhile allies. They discovered that Hammer's legacy was a biological toxin that had been ingested by every single villain who had ever worked for him and that one of the villains, [[Plantman]], was the carrier. Hawkeye, Songbird, and Plantman began a new search for the trigger that would release Plantman's toxin. The search ended with Hammer's daughter, Justine, who turned out to be the [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]], leader of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Hawkeye convinced several members of the Masters of Evil to side with him and Songbird against Crimson Cowl and their former allies, pointing out the dangers of the super-weapon. Hoping to throw off suspicion, Hawkeye made the villains reinvent their costumed identities, thus creating a new team of Thunderbolts. The group ultimately defeated the Crimson Cowl and her Masters of Evil, and Plantman (as Blackheath) managed to release an antidote for the toxin into the atmosphere.\n\nHawkeye and his Thunderbolts also helped [[Citizen V (Dallas Riordan)|Citizen V]] and the [[V-Battalion]] to help destroy their headquarters' engine of alien technology that had began distorting, In so doing, they were reunited with other the Thunderbolts, led by [[Baron Zemo (Helmut Zemo)|Baron Zemo]] and trapped on [[Coutner-Earth (Franklin Richards)|Counter-Earth]]. The two teams combined forces to shunt the alien ship from Earth. After much discussion, most of the costumed heroes and villains chose to part company. Hawkeye agreed to leave the Thunderbolts to Zemo's leadership, reluctantly agreeing that Zemo had proved he had potential to be a hero.\n\nHawkeye returned to the Avengers full-time. At one point, he and the [[Wasp]] had a dallying romance, upsetting Yellowjacket, and the two heroes avoided talking about the uncomfortable situation. Soon afterwards, however, the Avengers suffered a series of sudden and devastating attacks from friends and enemies alike, culminating in a surprise attack by the alien [[Kree]]. During the Kree invasion, Hawkeye suffered a mortal shot to the back. In his dying moments, Hawkeye overpowered a Kree soldier, using the soldier's jetpack to fly both of them into the Kree's command ship. Hawkeye sacrificed his life to single-handedly thwart the invasion. (These attacks were in part motivated by the Scarlet Witch, whose mind became unhinged with the magical powers she constantly felt forced to control, and it is believed the Kree invasion was all a [[Avengers Disassembled|magical construct]] of the Scarlet Witch.)\n\nHawkeye showed up alive once more in the Scarlet Witch's [[House of M|mutant-dominated alternate reality]], with no memory of the reality before. When a young mutant gave several of the heroes the ability to remember the way the world once was, Clint and the others were horrified at what the Scarlet Witch had done. With his memory restored, Hawkeye remembered the events his own death. When the heroes confronted the Witch and her children, Hawkeye angrily shot her in the back, demanding to know why she had killed him, as he was her friend and had only love for her. One of the Witch's children made Hawkeye vanish into nothingness with just a thought. After reality was restored several heroes arrived at the ruined [[Avengers Mansion]] after a report that someone had been there, only to find Clint's costume and a newspaper cutting about his death, pinned to the ruins by Hawkeye's trademark purple arrows. \n\n[[image:Capbarton.JPG|left|thumb|150px]]It was later revealed that Clint indeed survived and that he was the one who nailed the costume on the wall. He realized that the whole world thought that he was dead and he himself also had doubts of who he really was. In his disordered state of mind he found himself standing in front of [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]]'s house. He met Strange who ensured him that he was who he thinks he is and that he is indeed alive. Strange informed him of what had happened and that Wanda couldn't be found and that he thought she might be dead. Clint didn't believe this and started to search for her. He found her in [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] where she lived with her aunt Agatha. She didn't remember anything and didn't recognize him at all. She also told him that she had lived her whole life in that village. Clint decided to stay in the village for some time with her until he for some reason came back to the states and contacted Iron Man revealing to him that he was alive. After Iron Man had ensured that he was who he said he was he made Clint an offer to be the next Captain America. Clint even tried the flag on and got to use the original shield but he realized that it was a mistake when he met [[Patriot (Elijah Bradley)|Patriot]] and new [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Hawkeye]] who convinced that he wasn't Captain America. Clint let them escape and gave the shield back to Iron Man and told him that he will mail the \"flag\" later. Not long after this Clint again found himself in front of Doctor Strange's house now seeming as though it had been abandoned and sold to a franchise company. In reality, however, it was illusion cast by Strange to hide himself and his team members from Iron Man. They decided to show themselves to Clint and after some talk and magic they decided to give Clint Ronin's costume. They then left to Japan to save their team member [[Echo (Maya Lopez)|Maya Lopez]] from the [[Hand]].",

He was noticed by one Don Rigoletto, an accomplished crime boss who admired Fisk's sheer brutality and hired him as his primary enforcer. Fisk eventually murdered his benefactor and took control over his mob empire. Thus, the Kingpin was born. \n\nWhile his wife, Vanessa, knew of Wilson's criminal activities, he was careful to shield their only son, [[Fisk, Richard|Richard]], from the life he led. That effort was in vain, as Richard finally did learn of his father's mob connections. Richard faked his own death, and returned to New York as the Schemer, intent on destroying his father's empire. He had also taken on the guises of the original Rose and later, Blood Rose, but was never able to do much damage to the Kingpin's organization.\n  \nWilson Fisk is a criminal mastermind who is involved in extensive illegal activities such as drug running, smuggling, murder, and so forth. [[image:kingpin01.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]Despite this, he has no criminal record and an army of lawyers to keep it that way, and is a criminal financial strategist without parallel. Fisk has no superhuman powers, but the majority of his 400-plus pound bulk is solid muscle. When he delivered a kick to the Kingpin's back, [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]] could only think, \"Whatever that was, it wasn't fat. Felt more like rock\". He is a superb fighter who has held his own against [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], recently Daredevil occupies most of his attention. He has been aware of Daredevil's secret identity for years, thanks to Karen Page's indiscretion. Though Spider-Man and Daredevil are his greatest enemies, he has also tangled with [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], [[Moon Knight]], [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Dr. Strange]], the [[Punisher (Frank Castle)|Punisher]], the [[Avengers]], and [[Ghost Rider (John Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], among others. He has employed any number of costumed criminals and assassins, most notably [[Elektra]], [[Bullseye]], [[Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale)|Jack O'Lantern]], and [[Typhoid Mary]].  Recently blinded himself like his arch-nemesis Fisk found it hard to control his men as they now saw a weakness in their leader. The Kingpin's own son and a mobster from New Jersey named [[Silke, Sammy|Silke]] formed a coup and with the help of the Fisk's Captains seemingly assassinated him. They we're all tricked though, Wilson's man [[Dini]] found the Kingpin close to death and got him to safety.  Fisk's wife then took revenge on those that did this to her husband killing all involved (even her son) except Silke who got away and went to the F.B.I. for protection. It was Silke who told the F.B.I. about Daredevil's true identity.                                               \n\nThe Kingpin eventually regained his sight due to surgery, but no sooner had he been able to see the world again, he was thrown into prison for his crimes. But he wasn't through plaguing Daredevil yet; he was able to mastermind a plot that put Daredevil's secret identity into the hands of the F.B.I, and also managed to arrange the near-fatal stabbing of [[Nelson, Foggy|Foggy Nelson]], Daredevil's longtime friend and fellow lawyer.\nRecently, after Peter Parker revealed himself as Spider-Man, the Kingpin hired a sniper to kill the Parkers. But the bullet meant for Peter hit his Aunt May instead, who is currently in a coma. When Peter discovered this, he found and beat the Kingpin to near death, vowing to return to kill him when his aunt dies.",

He also used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler. However, Kraven's continual underestimation of the superhero's resourcefulness made him a frustrating quarry.\n\nFor a time, he gave up hunting Spider-Man, but his manipulative lover, [[Calypso|Calypso Ezili]], tricked him into believing Spider-Man set his caged animals free. Goading Kraven into resuming his pursuit, both she and Kraven were arrested. Convinced he would never be worthy of Calypso's love until he humbled Spider-Man, Kraven once again hunted Spider-Man. This time, Calypso muted Spider-Man's spider-sense, while the two battled. When Kraven realized Calypso had drugged Spider-Man with a hallucinogenic dart, he stopped the fight out of honor. The police captured the two again.\n\nAfter numerous battles in which Kraven was bested by the Wall Crawler, he finally defeated Spider-Man by shooting him and burying him for what would be his [[Kraven%27s_Last_Hunt|last hunt]]. He then donned Spider-Man's black costume and set out to prove that he was a greater Spider-Man than Spidey himself. He hunted down and defeated the creature known as [[Vermin]] who previously was only able to be defeated after Spider-Man enlisted the help of [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]].\n\nThe still living Spider-Man, who had actually been shot with a tranquilizer dart, clawed his way out from the grave and attacked Kraven but the hunter did not retaliate. Believing that he had regained his honor, Kraven released Vermin onto the streets. Spider-Man pursued Vermin while the deranged Kraven took his own life. \n\nYears later while spiderman was meeting with Al Kravinoff in a villains bar, Kraven reappears greyer but still alive.",

            "bio": "A Class Two Demon or [[Hell-lords|Hell-lord]], Mephisto rules a fiery nether realm that he refers to as Hell or Hades, though it is neither the Biblical Hell nor [[Pluto]]'s [[Mount Olympus|Olympian]] Hades. In the distant past, Mephisto became engaged to the lover of one of his former soldiers, then manipulated that demon into slaying his lover; the demon became [[Darklove]], cursed to always perform the opposite of love. Mephisto's realm includes the [[Arena of Tainted Souls]] where tainted souls are locked in perpetual combat. Mephisto delights in impersonating the Biblical Satan. Empowered by the souls of the damned, he often strikes deceptive bargains with the living. Mephisto takes particular interest in the souls of extremely powerful or exceptionally pure beings. \n\nLong ago, Mephisto entered a rivalry with the demonic [[Zarathos]] and struck a bargain with the young prince who eventually became [[Centurious]], the Soulless Man. Together, they brought down Zarathos, and Mephisto began a long process of tormenting Zarathos by bonding him with mortals. Knowing Zarathos was connected to the ancient [[Spirits of Vengeance]], Mephisto became obsessed with controlling the [[Medallion of Power]], a mystic talisman housing the essences of the Spirits. This led Mephisto to the Kale family, who bore shards of the Medallion within their souls. In the 18th century, Mephisto bargained with the overzealous madman Pastor Kale, hoping to gain the soul of the Pastor's son, [[Ghost Rider (Noble Kale)|Noble]]. This eventually led to the creation of the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Dan Ketch Ghost Rider]].\n\nThroughout history, Mephisto has exploited the spiritually adrift. In Europe, he granted a group of mystics (the future [[Mys-Tech]]) immortality in exchange for a yearly quota of souls. He also corrupted sea captain Joost van Straaten, who became the infamous [[Flying Dutchman]]. Benedicto de vica Severtes once dealt with Mephisto to gain the love of Beatriz, and prevented Mephisto from claiming his soul by encasing himself in mystical armor, becoming the [[Brass Bishop (Benedicto de vica Severtes)|Brass Bishop]], but after centuries of evading Mephisto, his soul was finally claimed when the hero [[Puck (Eugene Judd)|Puck]] cracked his armor. Prior to World War II, Mephisto duped a group of German scientists into believing in the Vril, a perfect race that had allegedly ruled Earth before the age of man and had relocated to an extradimensional realm. These scientists developed a portal to the Vril, though their project was shut down at war's end. Surviving project member Thule secretly continued this work in the Rocky Mountain base Schamballah, assisted by a growing band of neo-Nazis. \n\n[[image: mephisto01.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]In recent years, Mephisto has been increasingly fascinated by Earth's super-beings, and has particularly coveted the [[Silver Surfer]]'s pure spirit. Mephisto tried to tempt the newly Earth-bound Surfer with power and physical pleasure, even offering up the Surfer's beloved [[Shalla-Bal]], but the Surfer resisted. Undeterred by this failure, Mephisto has repeatedly threatened the Surfer, [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]], [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]] and many other heroes. He sent the ghostly Flying Dutchman back to Earth to attack the Surfer, but the Dutchman renounced Mephisto. When Noble Kale's descendant [[Kale, Naomi|Naomi Kale]] sought to undo the Kale family curse, she offered Mephisto her soul in exchange for his promise that the curse would not plague her firstborn son. She hoped this might break the curse forever, but Mephisto taunted her with assurances that even if her son John could not become \"the\" Ghost Rider, he could certainly become \"a\" Ghost Rider. Years later, when John Blaze turned to the occult in a futile attempt to save the life of his adopted father, Mephisto appeared to him in the guise of Satan. Claiming Blaze's soul, Mephisto bonded the human with the captured Zarathos as a new [[Ghost Rider (John Blaze)|Ghost Rider]]. \n\nMephisto's power over the soul of [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]]'s mother led him into several conflicts with the [[Latveria|Latverian]] monarch, battling each other annually on Halloween. Allied with fellow Hell-lords [[Satannish]], [[Thog]] and [[Satan (Marduk Kurios)|Satan]], Mephisto manipulated the demonic [[Six-Fingered Hand]] into helping him create Hell on Earth, but the non-team known as the [[Defenders]] thwarted their efforts. After Thor freed mortal souls from his Hell, Mephisto attempted to slay Thor's then-human form, Dr. Donald Blake, employing the deceased [[Darkoth]] against him, but Darkoth had no love for Mephisto, and had Thor destroy him. Mephisto has menaced the [[Fantastic Four]] on several occasions, including one involving the demonologist [[Cromwell, Elspeth|Elspeth Cromwell]] who mistakenly invoked him, allowing him to capture [[Mister Fantastic|Reed]] and [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]] and their son [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin]]. \n\nMephisto had gained tremendous power by the evil of the extraterrestrial [[Dire Wraiths]] who were invading Earth at the time, but lost this power when the spaceknight Rom banished the Dire Wraiths, and Mephisto was temporarily destroyed by Franklin. Mephisto later re-formed, missing five fragments of his essence. He tricked the villain [[Master Pandemonium]] into gathering these fragments, which Pandemonium believed to be pieces of his own lost soul, and Mephisto was eventually restored to full strength. This resulted in the destruction of the [[Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff)|Scarlet Witch]]'s twin sons, whom she had mystically created by unwittingly trapping and transforming two of Mephisto's power fragments. A rivalry developed with the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] death goddess [[Hela]], who stole several souls that Mephisto considered his. Scheming to force Thor to oppose Hela, Mephisto temporarily stole the souls of several heroes, including the Invisible Woman, [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Jean Grey]] and [[Rogue]], before finally claiming the one he'd sought all along: the Thunder God's. After a series of confrontations with the Fantastic Four, [[X-Factor]], the [[X-Men]] and the [[Avengers]], Mephisto freed Thor's soul, but his plot succeeded. Having seen the horrors in store should the realm of death ever expand to engulf the living, Thor vowed to stand against Hela's advances forevermore. \n\n[[image: mephisto02.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]With at least one rival neutralized, Mephisto sought other means of increasing his power. When the godlike [[Maker|Beyonder]] came to Earth seeking understanding of humanity, Mephisto attempted to sway him by offering his own warped view of mortals, sending Zarathos to test [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]'s morality. When Mephisto tricked the [[Heralds of Galactus|herald]] of [[Galactus]], [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]], into becoming more bloodthirsty in her duties, the Silver Surfer and Galactus both opposed the demon. Galactus and Mephisto engaged in a cosmos-shaking battle that left the Hell-Lord badly beaten. More failed attempts to gain the Medallion of Power followed, as well a brief period in which Mephisto served as an advisor to [[Thanos]], who then held the [[Infinity Gauntlet]]. Mephisto lied to Thanos about his origins, linking them to the [[Infinity Gems]], in the hopes of gaining the villain's trust. Thule's Eye of Force eventually achieved its goal, opening a portal to the \"Vril,\" only for them to be revealed as Mephisto's demon elite. Mephisto devoured Thule as payment, but his intended invasion of Earth was thwarted by [[Cloak]] and [[Dagger]], Spider-Man, and Ghost Rider (Dan Ketch). \n\nMephisto once stole the soul of [[Odin]] while he was in his Odinsleep, and [[Loki]] possessed Odin's form, but Odin ultimately reclaimed his body and Mephisto took Loki's soul, his true goal all along. After months in Hell, Loki's spirit eventually escaped. Mephisto empowered suicidal Chris Daniels into the superhuman [[Suicide]], cursing him so that only the Ghost Rider (Ketch) could slay him, hoping that Suicide could force Ketch into committing murder. The demon later attempted to seduce the Silver Surfer by mimicking the form of Nova (Frankie Raye), and Mephisto ruthlessly murdered Avengers member [[Mockingbird]] after the Avengers interfered in Mephisto's clash with rival demon Satannish over the souls of the [[Lethal Legion]]. Mephisto later helped the hero [[Hellcat]] destroy Satannish. \n\nAppreciating the strength mortals drew from family and friendships, Mephisto mystically created two children for himself: a son named [[Blackheart]], whom he deemed worthy of being his heir, and a daughter named [[Mephista]]. Mephista would wage war upon [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]], but Blackheart targeted first Daredevil and later the Dan Ketch Ghost Rider. Mephisto sought to teach his son the ways of ruling Hell, but Blackheart's ambition began to rival his own and they turned on each other. Blackheart temporarily overthrew his father and claimed the throne of Hell, but he eventually lost it to Noble Kale, who was in turn cast out by a renewed Mephisto. After reclaiming his throne, Mephisto once more began focusing on acquiring more souls for his realm. His efforts to claim the [[Black Panther (T'Challa)]] were thwarted when he was nearly overwhelmed by all of the Black Panther spirits throughout history. The [[Haazareth]] demons who granted Doctor Doom magical power against the Fantastic Four are within Mephisto's domain, and tormented Doom for their master when he offended their patronage.\n\nMephisto took advantage of Spider-Man's desperation to save his [[Parker, May|Aunt May's]] life, after she was shot by one of the Kingpin's snipers. In exchange for her restored health, Spider-Man had to sacrifice his marriage to [[Watson, Mary Jane|Mary Jane Watson]], as the demon would revel in the elimination of a sacred and holy bond of love, and Spider-Man's innate suffering (despite losing memory of the event). The couple agreed, and Mephisto altered time such that the Parkers never exchanged wedding vows. As part of the deal, Mephisto removed the knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity from the world. Through this event, [[Osborn, Harry|Harry Osborn]] was somehow restored to life.\n\n* '''NOTE''' - In the alternate future timeline of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Mephisto has a loyal daughter named Malevolence.",

Sinister agreed to help them, as long as he could have a DNA sample from Courier. This DNA sample allowed Sinister to replicate Courier shape shifting abilities, within Sinister’s own body.\n\nBy the early 20th Century, Sinister had cracked the genetic genome and was willing to share the information with Herbert Edgar Wyndham, who would later become the [[High Evolutionary]].\n\nDuring World War II, Sinister worked alongside the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], collecting as many blood samples as he could. It was during this time that he first saw [[Sub-Mariner]], and was inspired to create a clone of Namor. The clone was experiment [[N2]] and had varied success against the original Namor but was defeated by [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]].\n\nSome time later, Sinister recruited Gambit to gather together the Marauders and ordered the massacre of the [[Morlocks]]. Sinister cloned [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Jean Grey]] in the form of Madelyne Pryor, so that [[Cyclops (Scott Summers)|Cyclops]] would have a child with her, which Sinister would view as the ultimate mutant. Ultimately, Cyclops rejected Pryor when Jean returned from stasis, and the youth would be carried to the future, where he would return to present era as [[Cable]]. Sinister's machinations would lead to the event known as Inferno, where Cyclops supposedly killed Sinister with an optic blast, although Sinister resurfaced alive and well, when he revealed that there was a third Summers brother.\n\nSinister was involved in [[Stryfe]]'s attempted assassination of Xavier,, trading Cyclops & Jean Grey to Stryfe in exchange for their DNA. However, Stryfe actually gave Sinister the Legacy Virus, which would terrorize mutant (and eventually human) life, and lead to the deaths of several mutants.\n\nSinister later involved himself with [[X-Man|Nate Grey]] and the mutant [[Threnody]]. He joined the reestablished [[Weapon X]] program as Doctor Robert Windsor, claiming to help mutants escape Weapon X's mutant concentration camp \"Neverland,\" but in reality, he took them to be his test subjects.",

Although he ostensibly sought to fight for causes he believed in, Marc was easily persuaded to fight for anyone who paid him enough. While working in Africa, Marc met the French mercenary [[Frenchie (DuChamp, Jean-Paul)|Jean-Paul DuChamp]], whom he nicknamed \"Frenchie\". Marc and Frenchie became close friends, and served together on several missions.\n\n\n[[Image:Moon knight inline.jpg|left]]On one assignment, Marc helped overthrow the government of Bosqueverde, a South American country, and assassinated its president, [[Dominguez, Ricardo|Ricardo Dominguez]]. [[Raposa, Rodrigo|Rodrigo Raposa]] took over the country, having promised Marc he would install a new democracy, but he actually established a fierce dictatorship. Marc and Frenchie eventually fell in with [[Bushman, Raoul|Raoul Bushman]], a bloodthirsty terrorist. Bothered by Bushman's savagery and by his own stirrings of conscience, Marc began to question his mercenary lifestyle. During a mission to the Sudan, Marc saw Bushman assault the town of Selima, seeking information on archaeologist [[Alraune, Peter|Dr. Peter Alraune]]'s discovery of an Egyptian pharaoh's tomb which might contain gold. Dr. Alraune attempted to stab Bushman from behind, but Marc warned him in time, and Bushman slew Dr. Alraune by biting him in the neck with his steel teeth. \n\nDisgusted, Marc helped Dr. Alraune's daughter [[Alraune, Marlene|Marlene]] escape Selima, but Bushman caught Spector in the act. After Bushman executed the people of the town, Spector attacked him, only to be defeated by Bushman, who deposited the unconscious Spector in the desert and left him to die. Spector dragged himself through the sands to the tomb unearthed by Dr. Alraune and was found by Marlene and her servants. They brought him into the tomb, placing his body at the foot of a statue of the moon god, [[Khonshu]]. Marc was pronounced dead, but as Marlene wept over his body, he suddenly arose, alive. Spector believed that Khonshu had restored him to life to serve as the moon's knight of vengeance. Donning a cloak taken from Khonshu's statue, Spector destroyed Bushman's forces in Selima, but Bushman escaped when Marc was distracted by Marlene, who had followed him back to the town. Frenchie arrived to help them, and Spector collapsed into Marlene's arms, exhausted.\n\nAided by Marlene and Frenchie, Spector honed his abilities to wage war on crime. Using his mercenary profits, Marc created the identity of New York millionaire Steven Grant to help him mingle with influential people. He also created the identity of Manhattan cab driver Jake Lockley to make contacts with people on the streets. As Lockley, he befriended the homeless [[Crawley, Bertrand|Bertrand Crawley]], his main street contact, and [[Landers, Gena|Gena Landers]], a coffee shop owner whose sons [[Landers, Ricky|Ricky]] and [[Landers, Ray|Ray]] helped perform investigative work for him. Marc eventually shared his secrets with Crawley and the Landers family. Marlene, now Marc's lover, came to regard him as Steven Grant, and he suppressed his life as Spector. Although his multiple identities threatened Marc's sanity, Marlene helped ground his psyche. She also designed the Moon Knight costume for him, while Frenchie designed the first [[Mooncopter]], serving as Moon Knight's pilot. Marc brought the statue of Khonshu back to New York, still believing in the moon god's power.\n\n[[Image:Moon knight inline .jpg|left]]While Moon Knight was still establishing his reputation, Frenchie infiltrated the criminal financiers known as the [[Committee]] and learned of their plans to capture the [[Werewolf By Night|Werewolf]] Jack Russell. Frenchie offered Moon Knight's services to the Committee, claiming that Moon Knight was his employee. The Committee approved, and Moon Knight fought the Werewolf, defeating him when the sun rose and he became Jack Russell again. Moon Knight brought Russell, his lover [[Topaz]], and his sister [[Russell, Lissa|Lissa]] to the Committee, who revealed that they intended to use the Werewolf to kill their enemies, and hoped that Lissa would become a werewolf as well. A disgusted Moon Knight set the Werewolf free, rescued Topaz and Lissa, and helped the Werewolf defeat the Committee. Moon Knight moved on to other cases, thwarting the political manipulator Conquer-Lord, who used elaborate death traps in a plot to assassinate the mayor of New York City for the criminal Corporation; aiding the [[Defenders]] against the android [[Zodiac (LMDs)|Zodiac]]; battling the [[Masked Marauder]]'s [[Maggia]] alongside [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]; defeating the hirsute terrorist [[Lupinar]]; and aiding the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]] against Crossfire. \n\nMoon Knight faced his brother again when Randall went on a killing spree in New York, slaughtering nurses with a hatchet. Marlene bravely posed as a nurse to draw him out for Marc, and Randall nearly killed her. Moon Knight stalked Randall, who was seemingly impaled upon a broken tree, but Randall had actually left an imposter to take his place. Marc eventually learned that his friend Amos Lardner had died trying to escape from the CIA's Operation: Cobra. While investigating, Spector was attacked by Amos's brother [[Cobra (James Lardner)|James]], whom the project had brainwashed into becoming \"Cobra\". Moon Knight was able to short-circuit the technology controlling Lardner, who then turned on his controllers, killing them along with himself. \n\nMoon Knight faced other menaces such as the Slasher, a man slaying homeless people in an effort to find his father (who turned out to be Crawley); the [[Midnight Man]], an art thief; [[Morpheus (Robert Markham)|Morpheus]], a man able to control people through their dreams; [[Stained Glass Scarlet]], a nun who became a vigilante after being forced to kill her criminal son; [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]]'s enemy the [[Jester (Jonathon Powers)|Jester]]; [[Arsenal (Nimrod Strange)|Arsenal]] (Nimrod Strange) and his [[Third World Slayers]]; and the satanic cult the [[Left Hand Path]] and its leader, [[Morning Star]], whose goals led to another encounter with the Werewolf. Bushman returned to torment Spector by capturing the statue of Khonshu and destroying it. With the statue gone, Spector went insane, believing he needed Khonshu's guidance. When Marlene told him she had hidden the original statue and that Bushman had only destroyed a copy, Spector regained his sanity and defeated Bushman. It was only afterward that he thought to ask Marlene if she had told him the truth, but she observed that either way, it didn't matter.\n\nMoon Knight suffered another internal crisis when he faced Carson Knowles, a candidate for mayor who used the identity of [[Black Spectre]] to forcibly coerce people of influence in New York to support his campaign. Knowles had been inspired by Moon Knight to don his costume, noting how Moon Knight was feared by others because of his mask. In his first encounter with the Black Spectre, Moon Knight unmasked him, but was subsequently unable to prove that Knowles was the Black Spectre. As even Marlene began to doubt him, Moon Knight's sanity began to fray, until he turned again to the statue for guidance; he was able to draw the Black Spectre into another fight and unmask him on television, vindicating himself.\n\n[[Image:Moon knight inline 2.jpg|left]]After his father's death, Spector was outraged when his body was stolen by [[Zohar|Reuben Davis]], a former student of [[Spector, Elias|Elias Spector]] who had mastered Kaballah. Using the body as a power source, Davis took the name Zohar and used his magical power to punish Marc Spector for his sins. Moon Knight defeated Zohar, but Spector subsequently suffered another serious mental breakdown and decided to abandon all of his alternate identities to settle down with Marlene; however, he was contacted by three ancient Egyptian Priests who had served Khonshu for thousands of years, and they convinced him that he was truly the avatar of Khonshu. The priests guided Moon Knight into new adventures, his strength becoming superhuman during the full moon. Marlene, no longer willing to accept Marc as Moon Knight, left him. When members of the [[Avengers West Coast|West Coast Avengers]] were stranded in ancient Egypt via time-travel, their leader [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] formed an alliance with Khonshu, who contacted Moon Knight in the present to assist them. Moon Knight teamed with [[Yellowjacket (Henry Pym)|Henry Pym]] and Espirita to rescue the Avengers, and the assembled heroes defeated the alien entity [[Dominus]], who had stranded the Avengers in the first place.\n\nMoon Knight stayed with the Avengers for awhile, and was gradually accepted into their ranks; but Khonshu was responsible for influencing Spector to join the team, as Spector had no interest in being an Avenger. Marc became romantically involved with [[Tigra]], much to the disgust of Khonshu, who viewed her as a creature of the day. After Hawkeye's wife, [[Mockingbird]], tried and failed to conceal her role in the death of the [[Phantom Rider (Lincoln Slade)|Phantom Rider]] (who had raped her), the couple broke up their marriage, and Moon Knight joined Tigra and Mockingbird in leaving the Avengers since all three of them believed the team's rules against killing were wrong. The three ex-Avengers formed a group of their own for a time, and helped [[Goliath (Bill Foster)|Giant-Man]] (Bill Foster) escape the [[High Evolutionary]]. When the Phantom Rider's vengeful ghost haunted Mockingbird, the trio turned to [[Hellstorm]], who revealed that Khonshu's spirit had inhabited Moon Knight's body, and drove him out to help defeat the Phantom Rider. Khonshu left the earthly plane to battle rival god [[Seth]] thereafter, leaving Moon Knight without a reason to return to the Avengers. \n\nReturning to New York, Spector reconciled with Marlene and embarked on new adventures, encountering the thief [[Midnight]], son of the Midnight Man. Midnight tried to become Moon Knight's partner, but Moon Knight never took him seriously. Spector's past came back to haunt him when he was captured by the mercenary [[Silver Sable]] and brought back to Bosqueverde, now a democracy. Spector was to be tried for Dominguez's murder, but he convinced the new president, [[Silva]], to release him in exchange for hunting down Rodrigo Raposa. Moon Knight succeeded in bringing Raposa to justice, finally exorcising a demon from his past. Returning from Bosqueverde, Spector learned that Midnight had impersonated him in his absence and run afoul of the Secret Empire, who seemingly slew Midnight and transformed him into their cybernetic agent. Moon Knight joined Spider-Man, the [[Punisher (Frank Castle)|Punisher]], [[Darkhawk]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]], and [[Night Thrasher]] in opposing the [[Secret Empire]], and Midnight apparently died when the Empire's base was destroyed.\n\nLearning that Randall was still alive, Moon Knight joined the Punisher in hunting him. Randall, now called Shadowknight, fought his brother in an effort to claim the mantle of the Moon Knight. Marc finally slew Randall by knocking him off of a building. During this encounter, Marc learned that Khonshu was a god of justice, not only vengeance. He reinvented his Moon Knight identity, creating a new corporate image for himself through the company [[Spectorcorp]]. He moved his base to a high-tech office tower called \"Shadowkeep\", where he would meet with holographic representations of various special agents in what he called the \"[[Shadow Cabinet]]\". He also donned protective adamantium armor, and upgraded his weaponry. \n\nMoon Knight became involved in the doppelgangers used by the power-mad [[Magus (Adam Warlock)|Magus]] during the [[Infinity War]]. Moon Knight's double, [[Moonshade]], allied himself with the [[Richards, Franklin (doppelganger)|doppelganger]] of the powerful young [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin Richards]], unleashing a host of dimensional counterparts against Moon Knight in a failed effort to usurp his identity. Moon Knight's new mode of operations began to worry his super-hero peers. After he abused his Avengers privileges to gain access to the Latverian embassy for a confrontation with [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Dr. Doom]], the [[Avengers]] brought him up on charges. Unwilling to take the time to sit through these proceedings, Moon Knight destroyed his membership card and cut his Avengers ties. Moon Knight later became involved in a struggle against the [[Hellbent]], a sub-species of humanity interbred with demons. [[Seth the Immortal|Seth Phalkon]], leader of the Hellbent, claimed to be Moon Knight's great-great grandfather, and tried to unleash a computer virus called \"Zero Hour\" that would destroy every facility in Spector's network. To prevent the virus from taking thousands of lives, Spector sealed it within his headquarters. As a result, the Shadowkeep was destroyed, killing Spector.[[Image:Moon knight inline 3.jpg|left]] \n\nBut as before, death could not claim Marc Spector for long. Apparently again awakened by Khonshu, Spector was reunited with Marlene and Frenchie, and set out to oppose Morpheus, Bushman and Black Spectre, who had all become affiliated with the Egyptian god Seth, enemy of Khonshu. Black Spectre and the others tried to destroy the United Nations, but Khonshu guided Moon Knight against them, thwarting Seth's plan. Subsequently, Moon Knight learned Daredevil was assembling a team of heroes to capture the Punisher. Eager to help, he offered to finance a headquarters for the unnamed team (\"[[Marvel Knights]]\"). He joined the group against [[Cloak]] (controlled by Nightmare) and a teaming of [[Bengal (Duc No Tranh)|Bengal]], [[Tombstone]], [[Big Ben]] and [[Bullet]]. Finally, the team's base was invaded by [[Shang-Chi]]'s enemy [[Zaran (Maximillian Zaran)|Zaran]], who struck down Moon Knight with several of his miniature sais. Moon Knight's teammates brought him to safety while their base was blown up by agents of Fu Manchu. Seriously wounded by Zaran, and having lost significant money in the base's destruction, Spector was forced into retirement.\n\nHowever, Moon Knight has since recovered from his wounds and resumed his activities. He was among many former Avengers who briefly rejoined the team to fight the effects of the [[Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff)|Scarlet Witch]]'s out-of-control hex power. \n\nMoon Knight recently battled his long time rival Bushman in a brutal encounter, carving his arch enemy's face from his body. Broken knees however have kept the moon's Knight of Vengeance confined to a wheelchair. Recovering from the war with Bushman, Moon Knight is now stalked by [[Taskmaster]], who has been hired by the Committee to take him out.",

In approximately 1000 AD, Odin help found the [[Councils of God Heads]], who interceded when the extraterrestrial [[Celestials]] threatened to cut the gods off from Earth; Odin constructed the unstoppable armored [[Destroyer]] and the [[Odinsword]] should he face the Celestials in battle upon their return. Odin engaged the \"mad titan\" [[Thanos]] in a battle that ended in a stalemate, after Odin mistook Thanos' efforts to cure Thor of warrior madness as an attack upon his injured son. \n\nLater Odin perished during a subsequent battle with Surtur, Thor assumed his father's place and claimed the Odinpower, but it departed from Thor just as [[Ragnarok]] finally came to Asgard. Assuming a child's form, the Odinpower helped lead Thor on a journey to realize how [[Those Who Sit Above In Shadow]] had manipulated Asgard for ages; although Thor could not halt Ragnarok, he prevented Those Who Sit Above in Shadows from exploiting them further. Thor eventually reclaimed the Odinpower and revived all the Asgardians who had fell in Ragnarok, but Odin himself remained deceased. When Thor took an Odinsleep, he went upon a spiritual journey to a land of the dead where he found that Odin was locked in eternal combat with Surtur. Although Thor had the power to release his father, Odin preferred to remain where he was, ensuring that Surtur would never threaten his people.",

At this moment Jean had a vision of becoming the Phoenix but the vision faded from her memory as it ended. She soon fell in love with fellow student Scott Summers, and later would develop a strong attraction towards one of the team’s new recruits, the feral [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]]. \n\n\nAfter Jean and the X-Men defeated scientist [[Lang, Stephen|Stephen Lang]] and his robotic [[Sentinels]] on his space station, the heroes escaped back to Earth in a shuttle through a lethal solar radiation storm. Dying from radiation poisoning, Jean was saved by the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force who created a duplicate body complete with memories and personality, absorbed a portion of her consciousness and cast her into suspended animation in a strange cocoon at the bottom of Jamaica Bay. \n\nFor months the Phoenix believed itself to be the real Jean and saved the universe by healing the [[M’Kraan Crystal]]. Mental manipulation by [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] caused Phoenix to go insane and become Dark Phoenix. Ultimately, the portion of Jean’s consciousness within Phoenix resurfaced, causing it to commit suicide. This portion of Jean Grey’s consciousness then journeyed to the afterlife to meet a manifestation of [[Death (embodiment)|Death]]. Death explained the Phoenix Force to Jean, who now wore a White Phoenix costume, before this portion of her consciousness and residual Phoenix energy was sent to Jean’s original body in the cocoon, where it was rejected, and then to her clone, [[Pryor, Madelyne|Madelyne Pryor]]. Eventually, Jean was rescued from her stasis and, with the other original X-Men, formed a new team, X-Factor. Madelyne Pryor later died in a confrontation with Jean Grey in which Jean absorbed Madelyne’s and Phoenix’s personalities and memories and a spark of the Phoenix energy. While in battle with a [[Celestials|Celestial]] on an alien world, Jean expelled this spark of energy and the personalities she had absorbed but kept faint impressions of their memories. \n\n[[image: jeangrey01.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]Ultimately rejoining the X-Men, Jean and Scott eventually married and were temporarily teleported to a possible future to help raise Nathan Summers. Later, Scott seemingly sacrificed himself to stop [[Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)|Apocalypse]] from gaining the power of The Twelve. Apocalypse used Scott’s body as a host until his essence was removed from his body by Jean. However, Scott’s corruption by Apocalypse greatly strained his and Jean’s relationship. While on a mission to stop the [[Stranger]] from trying to destroy the universe, Jean used the Phoenix Force to get advice from the cosmic being known as [[Eternity]]. Later, Jean assumed the position of acting headmistress of the [[Xavier Institute For Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]] and was revisited by the Phoenix Force. Following an attack on the X-Men by a mutant impersonating [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]] named [[Xorn]] (who had previously been a teacher at the institute), Jean and Wolverine were trapped on a space station that was hurtling into the sun. Seeing no hope for survival and wanting to spare his teammate further suffering, Wolverine seemingly killed Jean, unleashing the Phoenix Consciousness within her and resurrecting her. Returning to [[Earth]], Jean, with the power of the Phoenix, opposed the faux Magneto and was killed by a massive stroke induced by a lethal electromagnetic pulse. \n\nAfter being killed by the faux Magneto, Jean hatched from a Phoenix Egg in the future. [[Sublime]] sought to use Jean’s Phoenix power to control all of creation. However, Jean remembered her mission and destroyed the future reality. Jean ascended to the [[White Hot Room]] as a White Phoenix of the Crown and created a new future by pushing Scott to stay with [[Frost, Emma|Emma Frost]] and continue the Xavier Institute. \n\nLater, a band of [[Shi'ar]] used their advanced technology to force the Phoenix Force out of the White Hot Room and shattered it with an 'Event Horizon'. Confused and driven insane, the Phoenix flew to Earth and forcefully resurrected Jean Grey. Jean ultimately merged with the Phoenix Force, once again becoming the White Phoenix, and returned to the White Hot Room to find its missing pieces.",

From this training, Punisher is proficient in not only basic infantry skills, but in special operations, which includes the use and maintenance of specialized firearms and explosive ordnance. He is highly trained in infiltration into heavily-guarded enemy territories and structures for the purpose of assassination, captures, and military intelligence. Also, he is trained in various forms of camouflage and stealth.  From his airborne training, Punisher is able to pack and maintain his own parachute rigs, as well as professionally control his landings, in daylight and at night. From his Navy UDT training, Punisher is well-skilled in extended underwater operations, including demolitions. He is skilled with a great many types of explosives, ranging from simple dynamite to plastique to improvised explosives. His hand-to-hand combat skills are more then sufficient to allow him to incapacitate and kill men much stronger than he is, as well as to deal with groups of armed and unarmed enemies, killing them all without weapons if he deems it necessary. He is also extremely deadly in knife training, preferring the knife he learned to fight with in the USMC: the ka-bar. Additionally, he is a preternaturally-precise marksman. He is thoroughly trained and experienced in unconventional (\"guerilla\") warfare. He is an armorer, a gunsmith, and an expert in field medicine.",
            "weapons": "The Punisher's ever-changing arsenal of weaponry includes various automatic and semi-automatic rifles, and an array of handguns, fragmentation and tear gas grenades, other explosives, and combat knives. A personal favorite is his ballistic knife, which can launch its blade with lethal force. He commonly uses M16 .223 caliber automatic rifles, Sterling Mark 6 9mm, semi-automatic rifles, 9mm Browning Llama automatic pistols, .45 caliber automatic frame rechambered for 9mm. ammunition, .223 caliber Derringers, and Gerber Mark II combat knives.",

Also prior to his enlistment, he married his wife Maria who was already pregnant with their first child. During his time in the United States Marine Corps (USMC), Castle graduated from Basic Training, then went on to Infantry School. Immediately following that, he went through the USMC's Reconnaissance, Force Reconnaissance, and Sniper Schools.  Attaining dockets, Castle was permitted to go through U.S. Army Airborne School, and U.S. Navy Underwater Demolition Team training, becoming qualified as a Navy Seal (Sea, Air and Land). He served in the Vietnam War in a special forces unit as a point man. For heroism in the line of duty, he was decorated with numerous medals, including the Purple Heart.",

He served in the Vietnam War in a special forces unit as a point man. For heroism in the line of duty, he was decorated with numerous medals, including the Purple Heart.\n\nShortly after a tour in Vietnam, Castle, his wife, Maria and their children were in New York's Central Park for an afternoon picnic when they witnessed a Mafia gangland execution; an informant had been hanged from a tree. Seeking to eliminate all witnesses, the Costa crime family murdered them on the spot. However, Castle survived.\nEven though Frank was able to identify all of the shooters the police were unable to help Castle in his quest for justice; they were tied in too deeply to the powerful Costa family. He decided that the only punishment criminals might receive is that of physical destruction. Shortly thereafter, he emblazoned his body armor with a symbol of a death's head, and exacted his revenge. Since then he has waged a one-man war upon crime, taking the name Punisher.\n\nIn his vigilante endeavors, Castle has crossed paths with several costumed crime-fighters, most notably [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Matthew Murdock)|Daredevil]]. These encounters have often resulted in his incarceration. While he is known to be significantly inferior to Daredevil in hand-to-hand combat skills, Punisher has been rated as one of the most dangerous criminals alive. When he was incarcerated in New York's [[Riker's Island]] Prison, though heavily outnumbered in gang-fights, Punisher has routinely killed armed, homicidal criminals with frightening ease, sustaining no injury. Due to his proficiency in fighting, he is rarely so accosted in prison environments. Adhering to his military philosophies, Punisher is constantly training whenever he is not out on actual maneuvers. He exercises fanatically to maintain his impressive physical conditioning and sticks to a balanced diet whenever possible.",

As a result, the victim's corpse appears to have a \"red skull\" for a head.

            "bio": "Johann Shmidt was born the son of an abusive, drunken German villager named Hermann Shmidt and his saintly, long suffering wife Martha, who for years endured abuse and beatings from her husband. Martha died giving birth to Johann, their only child. Driven to madness by the death of the woman he both loved and hated, Hermann Shmidt tried to drown the newborn infant, accusing him of murdering Martha. The doctor who had just delivered the baby saved Johann from his father, and the next morning Hermann Shmidt committed suicide. The doctor took Johann to an orphanage, where the child led a lonely existence. Johann ran away from the orphanage when he was seven years old and lived in the streets as a beggar and a thief. As he grew older he worked at various menial jobs but spent most of his time in prison for crimes ranging from vagrancy to theft.\n\nIn his late teens during the rise of the [[Nazi Party|Third Reich]], Shmidt got his most prosperous job, a bellhop in a major hotel. There he served the rooms of [[Hate-Monger (Adolf Hitler)|Adolf Hitler]] himself. By chance, he was present when Hitler was furiously berating an officer and swore he could train Johann himself, a simple bellhop, to be a better National Socialist. Looking closely at him and sensing his dark inner nature, Hitler decided to take up the challenge and recruited Shmidt.\n\nDissatisfied with the standard drill instruction his subordinates used to train Shmidt, Hitler took over personally. Upon completion, Hitler gave Shmidt a unique uniform with a grotesque red skull mask, and he emerged as the Red Skull. His role was the embodiment of Nazi intimidation, while Hitler could remain the popular leader of Germany. The Red Skull was appointed head of Nazi terrorist activities with an additional large role in external espionage and sabotage. He was spectacularly successful, wreaking havoc throughout Europe in the early stages of World War II. The propaganda effect was so great that the United States government decided to counter it by creating their own equivalent using the recipient of the lost [[Operation Rebirth]], Steve Rogers, [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]].\n\nThe two counterparts soon clashed in what would be a series of engagements throughout the war, ending with a final battle that left the Skull buried under the rubble of a bombed building. Because he was immediately exposed to an experimental gas there, he remained in suspended animation for decades.\n\nJohann was eventually rescued in modern times by the terrorist organization, [[Hydra|HYDRA]]. The Skull quickly subverted a HYDRA cell to his own ambitions of world conquest and the death of Captain America.\n\n[[image:MikeFichera--RedSkull-CosmicCube.jpg|thumb|left|The Cosmic Cube]]The Skull and Captain America resumed their personal war against each other. The Skull was consistently frustrated by failure; not even when the Skull possessed the reality-altering [[Cosmic Cube]] could he claim victory. At one point, the Skull's health failing, he had Nazi geneticist [[Zola, Arnim|Arnim Zola]] make him into an imitation of the Captain's civilian identity, Steve Rogers, using cloned tissue from Captain America's body. Under the alias of Mr. Smith, the Red Skull had [[Rockwell, Douglas|Douglas Rockwell]], the head of the U.S. president's [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]], make unreasonable demands upon Captain America, while  arranging for the [[Taskmaster]] to train a replacement for Captain America, appointed the violent and mentally unstable [[U.S.Agent|John Walker]]. When the CSA's requests forced Rogers to relinquish the Captain America identity, the CSA assigned John Walker to fill the role. As the new Captain America, Walker was manipulated by the Skull to act in a manner which publicly disgraced the image of the hero. The Skull then tried unsuccessfully to use Walker to kill Rogers (now \"the Captain.\") When Rogers defeated Walker, the Skull tried to blow the [[Dust of Death]] on Rogers. Walker hit the Skull him from behind with his shield, exposing Shmidt to the dust. He suffered the signature facial disfigurement attributed to the Dust, yet survived due to years of exposure to low doses. Rogers later reclaimed the Captain America title.\n\n[[image:redskull02.jpg|thumb|left|240px]]After this, the Skull was attacked by the mutant terrorist [[Magneto (Max Eisenhardt)|Magneto]], a Jewish Holocaust survivor who wanted to punish him for his involvement in Hitler's regime. Magneto buried him alive with enough water for a few months. The Skull remained there until he was rescued by his henchman [[Crossbones]].\n\nRed Skull had control over multiple criminal organizations, including the [[Watchdogs]], a group of right-wing militiamen, and the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], an organization devoted to murdering super villains. He proposed an alliance with the [[Kingpin|Kingpin of Crime]] (Wilson Fisk), one of New York City's top organized crime bosses, to bring a new designer drug to New York but the Kingpin refused to form an alliance with a Nazi. Fisk defeated the Skull in hand to hand combat, sparing his life on the condition he never come near the Kingpin's territory again. However fellow Nazi [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]], leader of the terrorist organization HYDRA, gratefully allowed the Skull the use of HYDRA's resources after the Skull's agents brought Strucker back from the dead.\n\nRecently, Red Skull manipulated his way into the position of Secretary of State, under the alias of Dell Rusk. Rusk developed a biological weapon he tested at Mount Rushmore, releasing a deadly spreading contagion \"red zone\" but was bested by Captain America and the [[Avengers]]. Desiring the Skull's Cosmic Cube for himself, former Soviet general [[Lukin, Aleksander|Aleksander Lukin]] hired Rogers' former WWII sidekick, Bucky (now known as the [[Captain America (James Barnes)|Winter Soldier]]) to assassinate the Skull. When the Skull was shot, he attempted to use the Cube to switch bodies with Lukin to survive, but the cube was weak. The transfer was only partially successful as the Skull only managed to transfer his mind into Lukin's body; now the minds of the two enemies were trapped together in the same body. The Skull/Lukin formed numerous alliances with other villains, including [[Doctor Faustus]], [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]], Arnim Zola and the [[Serpent Squad]]. The Skull used hypnotist Dr. Faustus to help arrange Captain America's assassination. Under Faustus' influence, former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent and Cap's occasional girlfriend [[Carter, Sharon|Sharon Carter]] was brainwashed into killing Captain America herself. Freed from his ever-present nemesis, the Red Skull/Lukin raised a private army while attempting to arrange for [[Wright, Gordon|Senator Gordon Wright]] to become president of the USA. The Winter Soldier became the new Captain America and overcame their plans. Arnim Zola transferred the Red Skull's mind out of Lukin's body and into one of his own spare android forms as a temporary measure. Shortly afterward, Lukin was killed by Sharon Carter and Zola was seemingly destroyed. The Red Skull remains trapped in Zola's spare body.",

As the Rhino made his way towards New York City, [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] began to formulate how to defeat this apparently unstoppable foe. His discovered two key factors: once charging, the Rhino cannot change directions or easily halt his advance. Second, Aleksei is rather dumb. Spider-Man deduced that if he could avoid a direct hit from the Rhino's horn, his superior tactical skills and agility would always leave him the final victor in any fair fight.\n\nSpider-Man defeated the Rhino sending the villain to a special state correctional hospital where he was kept under heavy sedation. After a few weeks, the Rhino broke out of the hospital and escaped, seeking revenge of Spider-Man. This time, Spider-Man defeated him using a specially-formulated version of his web fluid, devised with the aid of [[Lizard (Curtis Connors)|Dr. Curt Connors]], that contained encapsulated acid pellets whose containers dissolved upon contact with air. The special webbing rendered the Rhino's costume weak and brittle, which deprived him of needed impact resistance. The Rhino was recaptured, tried, and convicted.\n[[Image:Rhino01.jpg|thumb|left|260px]]\nThe Rhino served a commuted sentence and was discharged. When he was released, the spies who had transformed him, apparently showing no sign of malice towards his betrayal, approached him with the offer to strengthen him using a gamma-ray process. They had also devised an improved, acid-resistant material rhinoceros suit. Having no other prospects of gainful employment, the Rhino accepted the offer. The new series of radiation treatments were successful and doubled the Rhino's previous strength level. The augmented Rhino's first mission was to abduct [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Dr. Bruce Banner]], an authority on biochemical gamma-ray experimentation, also known as the Hulk. The spies planned to coerce Banner into developing an army of gamma-ray treated superhuman assassins. When the Rhino tried to abduct Banner, Banner transformed into the Hulk and overpowered the Rhino. Again, Rhino was sent to a state facility under heavy sedation and high security.\n\nThe Rhino's battle with the Hulk came to the attention of the [[Leader]], one of the Hulk's foremost enemies, who decided that further gamma-ray treatments would give the Rhino enough power to overcome the Hulk. The Leader freed the Rhino from the state facility, and further increased his strength by gamma-ray bombardments. The Leader then dispatched the Rhino to crash the wedding of Bruce Banner and [[Ross-Banner, Betty|Betty Ross]]. Succeeding in interrupting the wedding, the Rhino engaged in battle with the Hulk when the Leader accidentally shot him with a radiation blast intended for the Hulk. The Rhino turned on the Leader and caused the Leader's escape module to explode. (Banner's wedding to Ross was subsequently delayed for several years.) The Rhino was left comatose but otherwise unharmed and taken to a state hospital. The Leader used his mental energies to revive him, and reoutfitted him to battle the Hulk once again - this time with the Leader's mind controlling his every move. When the Leader released the Rhino, Aleksei was aboard a space shuttle battling the Hulk. The fight continued until the shuttle crash landed on the [[High Evolutionary]]'s artificial planet on the opposite side of the sun called [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]]. While the ship automatically repaired its damage, the Leader telemetrically signaled for it to return. The Hulk fought his way back on, the Rhino in tow. When the ship crash landed back on Earth, the Rhino lay buried in the wreckage for some time until he revived.\n\nThe Rhino was then recruited by [[Egghead]], as part of the criminal scientist's [[Emissaries of Evil]]. The Rhino was paired off with [[Solarr]] and sent to [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Dr. Strange]]'s sanctum to fetch the Star of Capistan, a jewel of power that Egghead mistakenly thought Strange had. The mission brought the Rhino in conflict with his old nemesis, the Hulk, as well as the [[Defenders]]. The Rhino was ultimately defeated by the [[Red Rajah]], a being in possession of Dr. Strange. He later battled and was defeated by [[Doc Samson]], and subsequently taken for study to [[Project: PEGASUS]], an enormous energy research facility in upstate, New York. After months of observations, the Rhino joined in a mass escape attempt along with fellow prisoners [[Moonstone (Karla Sofen)|Moonstone]], [[Blackout (Marcus Daniels)|Blackout]], and  [[Electro (Maxwell Dillon)|Electro]]. The escape was thwarted by the [[Avengers]]. While being transferred to another facility, the Rhino was freed by the [[Miracle Man]] who wanted the Rhino to help him regain his mystical powers. The Rhino did not wish to be freed, however, preferring to seek medical treatment to remove his costume which had affixed itself to his skin following he fiery shuttle crash. With the aid of the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)|Thing]], the Rhino opposed the Miracle Man, and accompanied the Thing back to PEGASUS where they again attempted to transfer him to the medical facility as arranged.\n\nThe Rhino was hired by the [[Green Goblin (Harry Osborn)]] hoping to earn cash to return to his homeland and convince his family to return back to America with him. Hired to scare Peter Parker, the Rhino was severely beaten by a furious Spider-Man. The Rhino's family was disgusted to learn the means Aleksei was using to gather funds.\n\nWhen the treatments failed to restore him to normal, the Rhino escaped and joined the [[MACH-IV|Beetle]]'s [[Sinister Syndicate]] to earn money to finance further operations. With teammates [[Speed Demon]], [[Hydro-Man]], and Boomerang, the Syndicate nearly overpowered Spider-Man until the timely rescue of the then-reformed [[Sandman (William Baker)|Sandman]] working for [[Silver Sable]].\n\nThe Syndicate reunited again, though soon fell apart due to the machinations of [[Beetle (Leila Davis)|Leila Davis]] seeking revenge against the Beetle, whom she held partly responsible for the death of her husband, the [[Ringer (Anthony Davis)|Ringer]]. Rhino hoped again to use earnings in the Syndicate to remove his suit. The team fell apart and the Rhino, working for the [[Kingpin]], was double-crossed. Rhino, overhearing the scientists who were instructed not to take remove the suit, kidnapped one of the scientist's children, and had his suit finally removed. The Kingpin, not one to be outdone, sent a fake-explosive package to the now more vulnerable Aleksei, letting him know he could always kill him if need be. Rhino, missing the excitement in life, requested [[Hammer, Justin|Justin Hammer]] to make him a new removable suit.\n[[Image:Rhino-Fegredo.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]\n\nRhino later found himself broke and alone during the holiday season. He stole a Santa Claus costume and made people \"give\" him money. He agreed to be a mall Santa, but became volatile when the kids did not get along with him. The Hulk was there, and a fight ensued in which the Rhino gored the Hulk. However, with a little girl crying, the Rhino spent the next few hours at the mall as Santa on much better behavior.\n\nThe Rhino even joined a minor league baseball team, wearing a suit of \"Mecha-Rhino\" armor, resulting in two clashes with the Hulk.\n\nIn the Great Game, a gambling operation run by a group of wealthy individuals who wager on the outcome of battles between their sponsored super-powered contestants, sponsor James Johnsmeyer sent the Rhino to pressure the deformed Spider-Man clone, [[Kaine]], into becoming a contestant. [[Joystick]] and [[Polestar]] joined the fight while the sponsors wagered on who would draw first blood. Double points were offered for Spider-Man as a wildcard while he tried to defend Kaine. Uninterested in joining the Game, Kaine seriously battered the Rhino while Spider-Man tackled Polestar and Joystick. \n\nIn another scientific experiment, the Rhino attempted to enhance his limited intelligence. The experiment was too successful, rendering him too smart for his own good. His new intellect ruined a romance, and he became suicidal. However, instead of giving up on life, he reversed the procedure and returned back to his former IQ.\n\nThe Rhino battled [[Hammerhead]]'s gang but was taken down again by Spider-Man. In Canada, the Rhino became subject to experimentation whereupon he was mutated into a half-man / half-rhino creature temporarily. The [[Juggernaut (Cain Marko)|Juggernaut]], attempting to reform his life, stopped the bestial Rhino, rejecting an opportunity to escape his own sentencing. The Rhino was reverted back to his previous superpowered self, whereupon he abducting and proposed to a French female singer/songwriter. Subsequently, after Spider-Man apprehended him, he was jailed in a special section of Ryker's Island prison for superpowered criminals at the same time as the [[Green Goblin (Norman Osborn)]]. The Rhino was seen free from jail, whereupon [[Wing, Colleen|Colleen Wing]] knocked down and apprehended him after she crashed [[Knight, Misty|Misty Knight]]'s Jaguar XK8 straight into him. After Spider-Man publicly revealed his secret identity, the Rhino was enlisted in the Chameleon's Exterminators team, and defeated Spider-Man. However, after the Chameleon's arrest, the Rhino was left unpaid, and went on a drunken rampage. However, the [[Black Cat]] convinced the Rhino to end his tirade while Spider-Man recovered.",

Academically gifted, Peter displayed an uncanny affinity for science that was nothing short of genius.  Socially, however, he was painfully shy and the target of much cruelty by his peers at [[Midtown High School]]. Attending a public science exhibit when Peter was 15-years old, he was bitten on the hand by a radioactive spider accidentally irradiated by a particle beam, empowering Peter with the arachnid's proportional strength and agility, and the ability to cling to almost any surface. [[image: spiderbite-LWeeks.jpg|frame|right]]Most incredibly, he had gained a sixth sense that provided him with early warning of impending danger. Disguised, Peter tested his new-found abilities defeating professional wrestler [[Crusher Hogan]] in the ring, and earning some cash.  Using his scientific prowess, he constructed a pair of artificial web-shooters that attached to his wrists. With an agent, a costume, and a new name, Spider-Man became an overnight sensation on television. Unconcerned with the rest of the world, he vowed to use his powers only to take care of himself and his aunt and uncle. After his first TV special ended, he allowed a burglar that he could have easily restrained to run past him and escape.  A few days later, Peter returned home to find his beloved Uncle Ben had been shot and killed. When Spider-Man confronted the killer hiding in the old Acme Warehouse at the waterfront, he discovered to his horror that his uncle's murderer was the burglar he apathetically allowed to pass. Consumed with guilt, he became aware at last that with great power comes great responsibility, just as his beloved uncle had once said.\n\nTo help his Aunt May with finances, Peter took a freelance job at the Daily Bugle selling pictures of himself as Spider-Man to publisher [[Jameson, J. Jonah|J. Jonah Jameson]]. Despite Spider-Man rescuing his son, astronaut John Jameson, from a malfunctioning space capsule, Jonah used his newspaper to publicly condemn Spider-Man as a menace. Unlike heroes like the [[Fantastic Four]] or the [[Avengers]], Spider-Man was mistrusted and feared by the public. At school, his popularity was no greater, as \"Puny Parker\" frequently clashed with bully [[Thompson, Flash|Flash Thompson]] and his followers. Flash's girlfriend, [[Osborn, Liz|Liz Allan]], often complicated matters, harboring a crush on \"Petey\" and making Flash jealous.\n\n=== A Gathering of Enemies ===\nSpider-Man soon found himself facing a rogue's gallery of powerful thieves, gangsters, and megalomaniacs including the [[Chameleon]], the [[Tinkerer]], the [[Vulture (Adrian Toomes)]], [[Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)]], the [[Sandman]], [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]], and [[Electro]]. In Florida, he befriended Dr. Curtis Connors after administering an antidote to reverse his transformation into the terrible [[Lizard]]. Though he had many enemies, he also shared adventures with the [[Fantastic Four]] (including rival the Human Torch), the [[Avengers]], the [[X-Men]] and [[Daredevil]]. At the Daily Bugle, he discovered a friend and his first love, Jameson's secretary, [[Brant, Betty|Betty Brant]]. Even more villains clashed with Spider-Man including the [[Iron Patriot (Norman Osborn)|Green Goblin]], the Big Man and the Enforcers, [[Mysterio (Quentin Beck)]], and [[Kraven (Sergei Kravinoff)|Kraven the Hunter]]. Dating Betty became awkward after her brother, Bennett, was murdered in a clash between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man. Betty at first held Spider-Man responsible. Though she later recanted, the thought of Spider-Man reminded her of losing her brother. At home, Aunt May suffered a heart attack, causing Spider-Man to abandon a fight with the Green Goblin. For a while after, the public viewed Spider-Man as a coward, before he made a comeback. May's fragile health and poor finances, however, remain a lingering concern. Frustrated by their defeats at the hand of Spider-Man, six of his top villains gathered forces under Doctor Octopus to form the [[Sinister Six]]. Through wits and determination, Spider-Man defeated the group one at a time. \n\nPeter Parker’s confidence gradually increased. At the same time, his relationship with Betty crumbled as handsome reporter Ned Leeds stole her heart. Jameson took his campaign against Spider-Man to a new level, sponsoring the creation of the deranged [[Venom (Mac Gargan)|Scorpion]], under Dr. Farley Stillwell. Though the Scorpion turned on Jameson, the publisher persisted with attacks against Spider-Man, and rented the first of a series of robotic Spider Slayers invented by Dr. Spencer Smythe. Spider-Man was able to use his technical know-how to defeat the Slayer. While Aunt May persisted with attempts to introduce Peter to [[Watson, Mary Jane|Mary Jane Watson]], the niece of neighbor Anna Watson, Spider-Man tackled organized crime led by the Crime Master and the Green Goblin. Tired of the Bugle's harassment, Peter tried selling pictures for the Daily Globe but gave up when the Globe's editor proved too nosy. \n\n=== Big Super-Hero on Campus ===\n[[image:Pete-Gwen-gang-JRSR.jpg|frame|left]]After capturing a new foe, the Molten Man, Peter Parker graduated high school and earned a science scholarship to Empire State University (ESU) for achieving the highest scholastic average in Midtown High's history. College brought a fresh start with new peers including the wealthy [[Osborn, Harry|Harry Osborn]], son of industrialist Norman Osborn, and beauty queen of Standard High, Gwen Stacy; Flash Thompson followed Peter to ESU on an athletic scholarship. Consumed with worry about his aunt's hospitalization, Peter was misunderstood as an unfriendly snob by Harry and Gwen. Because a previous transfusion of his radioactive blood to Aunt May was slowly killing her, Spider-Man enlisted aid from [[Lizard (Curtis Connors)|Dr. Connors]]. The antidote that had been called in to cure Aunt May was stolen, and Spider-Man fought like a madman to retain it. Before Spider-Man could deliver the antidote, ISO-36, he was trapped under rubble in a battle with the \"Master Planner” (revealed to be Doctor Octopus). Spider-Man courageously forced his way out to administer the elixir to Aunt May.\n\nWhile Aunt May convalesced, Peter relaxed and befriended Harry and Gwen. Soon after, the Green Goblin negated Spider-Man's spider-sense, and kidnapped him. There, the Goblin revealed himself to be Harry's father, Norman. The two battled, but Spider-Man triumphed knocking the Goblin into live wires and chemicals. Norman was left with partial amnesia, blocking his memories of being Goblin and of Spider-Man's identity.\n\nThe Avengers invited Spider-Man to join their ranks, but after facing the Hulk, he declined the offer, preferring the freedom of working alone. Meanwhile, Peter could no longer evade meeting Mary Jane. Assuming the worst, Peter was stunned to discover she was both gorgeous and vivacious.  Their first date involved riding into the city on Pete's new motorcycle take pictures of the Rhino. After another battle with the Lizard and new foe, the Shocker, Peter moved into Harry's apartment, rent free. Despite his new found independence, happiness eluded him. Worn out by Jameson's editorials, the public's fear of him, Aunt May's fragile health, slipping grades, and floundering love life, Peter decided to become Spider-Man no more. While Peter enjoyed time studying, and being with friends and family, crime escalated as the Kingpin's initiated his master plan to oversee the criminal underworld. After Peter rescued a watchman resembling Uncle Ben from two robbers, he renewed his vow to never let an innocent come to harm because he failed to act. Subsequently, Spider-Man battled the [[Kingpin]], Doctor Octopus (who became Aunt May's boarder), a new Vulture, a new Spider Slayer, and Mysterio.  He and the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] went to Hollywood where they tackled Mysterio and the [[Wizard]].\n\n=== The Girl, the Goblin, and the Great Heartbreak ===\nThough Peter dated MJ on occasion, he soon fell for the more serious-minded Gwen, causing tension between Harry and himself. Peter met Gwen's father, retired police Captain [[Stacy, George|George Stacy]], who studied Spider-Man, and questioned Peter about his first-hand experience. The Kingpin brainwashed Capt. Stacy (using Norman Osborn's equipment) into stealing police records. After Peter published pictures exposing Stacy, the Kingpin kidnapped George and Gwen. Spider-Man and Osborn rescued the two, but the Kingpin escaped. The Kingpin next focused on stealing a legendary stone tablet but Spider-Man retrieved it, and left it with Capt. Stacy. The Shocker stole it back, and Dr. Connors was forced by Man Mountain Marko to translate it for an aged gangster, [[Silvermane]]. Connors revealed a formula for a youth potion. Silvermane drank the liquid, and became a young man again. Tragically, he could not stop the de-aging process, and shrank so small, he ultimately disappeared. Meanwhile, the stress on Dr. Connors triggered a transformation again. After a fierce melee across the city, with unwelcome help from the Human Torch, Spider-Man rescued Connors.\n\n[[image:Gwendeath01.jpg|frame|right]]Though Peter's frequent unexplained disappearances as Spider-Man have caused friction with Gwen, their love for each other gave Peter hope for a happy future together. As the bond between Peter and Gwen grew ever stronger, it was approvingly observed by Gwen's father, Police Captain George Stacy, who also supported the efforts of Spider-Man. But tragedy struck when Captain Stacy was crushed by a falling chimney, saving an innocent child during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. With his dying breath, Captain Stacy told Spider-Man, \"take care of Gwen, Peter\". Spider-Man had lost a great ally. \n\nGwen blamed Spider-Man for her father's death.  Peter's conscience, already tormented by the ever present need to lie to Gwen, became even more troubled.  Yet their love prevailed through life's challenges - including Harry's drug addiction, and Spider-Man's aborted attempt to remove his own powers, that instead resulted in him being transformed into a six armed freak. In the end, it was death which separated the two lovers.  The Green Goblin kidnapped Gwen, and dropped her off the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man tried, but failed to save her.  In the vicious battle which followed, Norman was accidentally impaled by his own Goblin Glider. His apparent death was secretly observed by his son, Harry, who swore his own revenge on Spider-Man. Harry soon succumbed to the Osborn Legacy, kidnapping those whom Peter loved most, only barely being stopped from finishing the work that Norman Osborn had started.\n\n=== A Clone is Born ===\nMeanwhile Peter and Gwen's college Professor, Miles Warren, had begun his own deadly schemes as the [[Jackal]]. Miles blamed Spider-Man for the death of Gwen, whom he had himself fallen in love with. The climax of the Jackal's plan was his creation of a [[Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly)|Spider-Man clone]], but at the conclusion of the final battle, both the Jackal and the clone were killed. With their departure, Peter's life returned to normality, as much as it ever could for a college student who was secretly a costumed super-hero.\n\nIn the meantime, Peter and Mary Jane realized that their relationship had become far more than just friendship. So much so that, shortly before his college graduation, Peter proposed to Mary Jane. But she had seen too much pain in her own family, and she turned him down. She left New York to pursue her modeling career in Florida, and Peter Parker moved on to post-graduate studies. It was a time for new challenges, and new friends.  But one thing would never change; the ever-present responsibility he faced as Spider-Man. \n\n=== Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places ===\nEntering his post-graduate studies, Peter's close college friends began to find their own lives. Liz Allan was dating (later to marry) a recovering Harry Osborn.  Flash Thompson was looking for a life after football and the army, with his girlfriend Sha Shan. Betty Brant had married Bugle reporter [[Hobgoblin (Ned Leeds)|Ned Leeds]]. Even Peter's Aunt May had found romance with [[Lubensky, Nathan|Nathan Lubensky]], fellow occupant of the convalescent home she had moved into. With his friends all in cozy couples, Mary Jane's departure was all the more unsettling. But it was not long before Peter began dating again. He enjoyed several dates with Cissy Ironwood. Also, departmental secretary Deborah Whitman was attracted to Peter, but failed to win his heart. Dawn Starr, undergraduate student, pretended to date Peter though actually wanting to sneak a look at an upcoming exam. Amy Powell tried to use Peter to make her fiancé Lance Bannon jealous.\n\n=== A Partner in Crimefighting ===\nThese women had one thing in common - Peter Parker. But when [[Black Cat|Felicia Hardy]], crossed Spider-Man's path, things were different. Felicia was beautiful, talented, and determined.  She was also an unrepentant burglar who had a romantic fascination with her web-slinging hero. Spider-Man persuaded Felicia to turn away from crime, and the two of them became lovers - and crime-fighting partners. Felicia urged Peter to spend more and more time in costume. The glamorous Black Cat could never bear to see her super-hero living the squalid life of post-grad student. Becoming Spider-Man was made easier since Aunt May had recovered enough to return home and open the Parker residence as a boarding home for retired people, aided by Nathan. Aided by the Black Cat, Spider-Man faced Doc Ock and the [[Owl]] - a battle which nearly cost Felicia her life.  Peter was brought crashing down to earth. He realized that without super-powers, Felicia was just like the others from his past, who had so often paid the price for Peter being Spider-Man. \n\n=== The Redhead Returns ===\nWhen Mary Jane returned from Florida she found Peter and the Black Cat in a shaky and tempestuous relationship. Felicia could not bear the thought of Peter not allowing her to accompany him into battle, and she embarked on a secret search for super-powers at any price. Tricked by the Kingpin, and twisted in her own deceit, the Black Cat and Spider-Man finally parted ways. In contrast, Mary Jane was determined not to let lies come between her and Peter Parker. She finally told Peter that she had known for some time about his secret identity. With Spider-Man's secret finally out in the open, Peter and Mary Jane's relationship found new depth.  \n\n=== Peter Makes a New Friend from Outer Space ===\n[[image:BlackCostume-CVess-WOS1.jpg|frame|left]]Certainly there always was plenty of action for Spider-Man in New York, especially with the appearance of the deadly [[Hobgoblin]], and Peter's troubles with his symbiotic black costume he obtained after being whisked away to the [[Secret Wars]], a battle on a far away world between the Earth's greatest heroes and villains orchestrated by the enigmatic [[Maker|Beyonder]]. His costume shredded, Spider-Man thought he obtained a new black and white costume (similar in design to the new [[Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter)|Spider-Woman]]) from a costume making machine. After returning home to Earth, Peter discovered his costume was actually a living entity, feeding off his adrenalin as it possessed his body while he slept. Thanks to [[Mister Fantastic]], the costume was removed by sonic blasts, and captured. It escaped, still emotionally dependant on Spider-Man and reattached itself. Spider-Man forced it off by the loud noise atop the bell-tower of a church (where the alien costume would later attach itself to Eddie Brock forming [[Anti-venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]]).\n\n=== Wedding Bells for the Webhead ===\nAs Spider-Man, Peter faced the death of his good friend [[Dewolff, Jean|Police Captain Jean DeWolff]] at the hands of the [[Sin-Eater]]. He watched Flash Thompson be taken for a criminal, and Ned Leeds killed, both for their involvement with the Hobgoblin. But things were different now - he had Mary Jane by his side. Peter proposed for a second time, and was accepted. As newlyweds, Peter and Mary Jane shared happiness, but faced many perils also. Mary Jane was menaced by both Kraven the Hunter, and by Venom, both of whom knew Peter's identity. Mary Jane loved Peter, and had deep respect for his sense of responsibility. But she was unprepared for the loneliness, the fear for his life, and the nagging doubt that perhaps Peter needed Spider-Man far more than he needed her. During this time, Spider-Man gained the cosmic powers of [[Captain Universe]] making him virtually indestructible, able to fly, shoot cosmic energy blasts, and possess unimaginable strength. This temporary augmentation allowed Spider-Man to defend himself against a new assortment of foes (including [[Graviton]], [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]], [[Titania (Mary MacPherran)|Titania]], and [[Dragon Man]]), as villains attempted to aid each other by targeting each others' enemies. At the opposite extreme, Spider-Man temporarily lost all of his powers under the trickery of the [[Chameleon]], but was aided by the Black Cat in restoring his abilities. Spider-Man, along with the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]], [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], and [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]] briefly formed an unofficial ad-hoc Fantastic Four team, while the real Fantastic Four were captured by Skrulls. The group quickly disbanded.\n\nAmongst the daily battles with New York's villains, and the challenges of keeping his marriage alive, Peter soon faced the inexplicable return of his parents, [[Parker, Mary|Mary]] and [[Parker, Richard|Richard Parker]]. Long since believed dead, they claimed to have lost their memory of the intervening years. Aunt May was not ready to accept them, but Peter finally believed them to be what they claimed to be, even showing them his identity as Spider-Man. But Peter's heart had over-ridden his instincts. The pair were eventually revealed as robot agents of the Chameleon, part of a plan prompted by Harry Osborn, recently returned as the Green Goblin. Spider-Man was filled with anger at this deeply personal attack.  It seemed to him that those he loved were fated to die, while the evil in his life would always return to haunt him.  \n\n=== I Am the Spider ===\nA darkness began to fill Spider-Man's heart, like never before. Still brooding over the Chameleon's invasion of his life, and Harry's death after a twisted attack on both the Osborn and Parker families, Peter was then faced with Aunt May's serious heart attack. May hospitalized, and not expected to recover. Peter's frustration at life's injustices boiled over into violence. Encountering the recently reformed and powerless Scorpion, Spider-Man cruelly beat his former foe close to death - ignoring his victim's pleas for mercy. Calling himself \"the Spider\", it seemed that Peter was even beyond Mary Jane's powers to heal him.  In the end, his salvation came at the hands of [[Judas Traveller]], a psychologist with most unusual methods. Peter's recovery from his dark madness coincided with the return of a figure from Peter's distant past - his clone, created by the Jackal. The clone had survived, and had wandered the U.S. using the adopted name \"Ben Reilly\". Learning that Aunt May was very ill, the clone returned to New York, just in time to see her pass away. He adopted a costumed identity as the \"Scarlet Spider\", and portrayed himself as Peter's long-lost cousin. Peter and Ben became friends, even almost brothers. The Jackal himself had also survived. Deceived at the hands of Norman Osborn, the Jackal declared that in fact Ben was the original, and Peter the clone. Though Peter took the revelation badly, Ben subsequently took over the role of Spider-Man, leaving Peter and pregnant Mary Jane free to enjoy a \"normal\" life. Peter returned to his scientific career, though hampered by having never completed his doctorate. He and MJ also tried moving to Portland, until they realized that New York was where they truly belonged. But all too soon, their new world was shattered when Norman Osborn burst back into their lives. He also had survived his apparent death, and was the mastermind behind all of the Jackal's schemes. Norman killed Ben, revealing him to be the clone after all. But Norman's schemes went even deeper and deadlier than ever - he apparently caused Mary Jane to miscarry the baby and held Peter's Aunt May hostage. The woman believed to have been Aunt May that had died was a genetically modified actress, part of a subtle plot which was never carried to fruition. \n\n=== A New Chapter ===\nReunited at last, Peter, Mary Jane, and Aunt May moved into a luxurious apartment. With the Green Goblin defeated in battle, driven more deeply insane by a mystical ceremony, Peter promise Mary Jane that he would give up being Spider-Man and concentrate on their family. He took a job at Tri Corp Research while Mary Jane returned to modeling. But after various emergencies and the appearance of a new Spider-Man (actually [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]]), Peter could not seem to keep his word.\n\nWhile Mary Jane was being increasingly threatened by an anonymous stalker, Peter was secretly breaking his promise and returning to web-slinging. Mary Jane, preoccupied with modeling, was distraught feeling a space grow between her and Peter. After catching Peter still active as Spider-Man, MJ vanished when a plane she had boarded exploded. Peter was devastated. Aunt May returned to her home in Forest Hills, while Peter returned to his bachelor lifestyle moving in with Randy Robertson. He socialized with Randy, [[Grant, Glory|Glory Grant]] (now a couple), and Gwen's cousin [[Stacy, Jill| Jill Stacy]] while his attractive neighbor, Caryn intrigued him. But with Peter still emotionally adrift, Norman picked the perfect time to drug Peter and incite him to becoming his heir. But even lost and confused as he was, Peter proved that his could resist Osborn's brainwashing attempt. Meanwhile, Mary Jane was not dead, but had been kidnapped by her stalker. Spider-Man managed to rescue Mary Jane, only to discover that she needed time away from him. Mary Jane left for the West Coast, leaving Peter to struggle with a loss almost as traumatic as her apparent death. While Peter turned to his Aunt May for support, May discovered Peter's greatest secret, visiting unannounced, and finding him asleep in costume after his grueling victory against [[Morlun]]. After coming to terms with the truth, May quickly became Spider-Man's strongest supporter, and the two became closer than ever.  At May's suggestion, Peter returned to Midtown High, now more rundown that Peter remembered it, to teach science part-time. With renewed hopes, Peter and Mary Jane agreed to try once to make things work between them. After their time apart, Peter earnestly assured Mary Jane that he truly needs her in his life.\n\n=== A Mystical Connection? ===\nThe mysterious [[Ezekiel]], who shared similar spider-like abilities, made Peter question the source of his powers, implying a mystical reason the spider chose to bite him. Ezekiel had stolen his powers through an arcane ceremony and needed to sacrifice Spider-Man to keep them. When his ritual joined their minds, however, Ezekiel realized Spider-Man was the worthy hero and sacrificed himself. \n\n=== A Past Indiscretion ===\n[[image: Spidey banner.jpg|frame|right|200px]]Back home, Spider-Man fought the two adult children of his ex-love, Gwen Stacy. Years before, Gwen had an affair with Norman Osborn, subsequently became pregnant and rapidly gave birth to twins, [[Stacy, Gabriel|Gabriel]] and [[Stacy, Sarah|Sarah]]. After his own apparent 'death,' Osborn raised the pair, who were aging rapidly due to their genetic inheritance of the Goblin formula. Osborn told them that Peter was their father and had killed their mother but Spider-Man eventually made them face the truth. \n\n\nOsborn also revealed Spider-Man's identity to the [[Venom (Mac Gargan)|Scorpion]], and had him kidnap Aunt May. Osborn had been publicly revealed as the Green Goblin and jailed after murdering journalist Terri Kidder. He knew big businesses had been conspiring for decades to create super-villains and, as a potential whistle-blower, was an easy target in prison. Osborn wanted Peter to break him out in return for May's freedom, but when Peter did, a battle erupted with the [[Sinister Twelve]], including Gargan himself - now the new Venom after bonding with the alien symbiote. Spider-Man, with the help of other super-heroes, was able to defeat the Sinister Twelve and save his Aunt May. Around this time, Spider-Man met the [[Queen]] who had powers allowing her to control the world's insects, eventually causing Spider-Man to mutate into a giant spider. She planned to detonate a bomb that would kill everyone except those with the \"insect\" gene but Peter returned to his human form and stopped her, augmented with enhanced powers including silk glands within his forearms. \n\n=== Major League ===\nAfter a breakout at the [[Raft|Raft Security Prison]], Spider-Man joined the Avengers (newly formed in the aftermath of the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s attack on her own team). An old classmate of Peter's named [[Weiderman, Charlie|Charlie Weiderman]] went on an insane rampage after his experiments covered him in [[Vibranium]], and burned down the Parker's home in Forest Hills. Peter moved into Tony Stark's tower with Aunt May and Mary Jane. For this and various other reasons, Spider-Man's secret identity was shared with many of the world's heroes including the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, providing him with an venue to communicate among his peers.\n\n[[image:Ironcostumespideyinline.jpg|frame|left|200px]] \n\n=== The Other ===\nMorlun returned again, viciously beating Spider-Man, removing an eye, and hospitalizing him. Mary Jane tried to stop Morlun from finishing off her husband. But when Morlun threatened to kill her, Spider-Man gave the last of his energy to protect her. With stingers that burst from his wrists, Spider-Man slayed Morlun. Spider-Man then apparently died; however, a new Peter Parker emerged from the old corpse, now more fully embracing his \"other\" self - his spider personae. Retaining his stingers, he discovered other new abilities including night vision, greater control of his skin adhesive properties, and enhanced sensory perceptions, such as being able to sense the vibrations traveling through his webline. [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Tony Stark]] looking at Peter as his protégé, gave Spider-Man a new technologically advanced costume with a red and gold color scheme as a gift. \n\n=== Choosing Sides, Unmasking, and Switching Teams ===\nIn the aftermath of a tragedy in Stamford, Connecticut, in which a band of televised heroes were unable to prevent the villain [[Nitro]] from killing an entire elementary school full of children and parts of the surrounding community, the U.S. government propelled forward the Superhuman Registration Act requiring the superhero community to register themselves as living weapons of mass destruction, and reveal their identities to the government. The act was supported by Tony Stark, who became the leader of the Pro-Registration side. The superheroic community was split between registering or refusing and becoming an outlaw. Leading the opposition to the act was [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]], in defense of heroes' right to privacy. To support Iron Man, and perhaps obtain the ever-elusive respect from the public by compliance with the Act, Spider-Man made the difficult decision (with support from May and Mary Jane) to reveal his identity to the world during a press conference. As Spider-Man now faces the danger of public exposure to his family and loved ones, and the prospect of having to capture his renegade friends in what has become an all-out [[Civil War]] in the superpowered community, Peter regretted his decision. After witnessing a prison in the Negative Zone for super humans who refused to register, Parker fled Avengers Tower with his family, clashing with Iron Man during his exit. He aided Captain America and the forces opposing registration, culminating in a major battle during the jailbreak of the heroes imprisoned in the Negative Zone, Captain America's surrender, and the end of the Civil War. Spider-Man has remained a member of the unsanctioned Avengers team in the aftermath. Since Spider-Man's identity is now public knowledge, the Kingpin arranged a sniper to slay the Parker family. Though Mary Jane was spared, Parker was unable to prevent his aunt from getting shot. May was left in a coma on the verge of death. The anguish of yet another loved one injured because of his life as Spider-Man embittered the hero. He resumed wearing his black cloth costume, reflective of the dark times while his Aunt May was precariously close to death. Spider-Man confronted the Kingpin in Ryker's Island prison, and, while unmasked, beat him within an inch of his life, vowing to come back and kill him if Aunt May died.\n\n=== A Brand New Day and Hitting the Big Time ===\nWith time running out, Peter tried several avenues, from the technological to the mystical, to save May's life. At a dead-end, [[Mephisto]] appeared to Peter and Mary Jane offering to prevent May’s death, but at the cost of their holy bond of matrimony. After spending one more day together, Mary Jane selflessly took the initiative and agreed to the bargain, knowing Peter would never forgive himself if he rejected a chance to save May. She had faith that their love would be strong enough to reunite them. As a result, one event was removed from the lives of Peter and Mary Jane - they were never married, and Aunt May survived the shooting. Realizing how dangerous it was to reveal his secret identity, Peter, through the combined efforts of Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, and Reed Richards, had the world not only forget he was Spider-Man, but be mystically confused if ever considering they were the same person. Mary Jane was exempted from forgetting, but later broke up with him, unable to cope with the strain of being Spider-Man's girlfriend.\n\nSingle and jobless, Peter was reunited with his old friend Harry Osborn - whose death had been part of an elaborate hoax by his father. Spider-Man also returned to using web-shooters, rather than his own self-generated organic webbing, for reasons that have not yet been revealed. Over time, Peter unmasked again to a select group of heroes including the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. Through connections with Marla Jameson, Peter acquired a dreat job at Horizon Labs, where his skills as a brilliant scientist and inventor have earned him a steady paycheck. Marla's death, killed by Spider-Slayer Alistaire Smythe, inspired Spider-Man to promise that nobody else dies on his watch. The Jackal (or possibly a clone), partnered with the Queen and turned New York City into \"Spider-Island\" wherein bedbugs gave many the powers of Spider-Man. Peter and his colleagues at Horizon helped stop the plague. Peter's girlfriend at the time, forensic detective Carlie Cooper, temporarily gained powers in the event. Afterwards, she discovered Peter's secret identity and broke up with him. Despite their differences, she remains an ally.\n\nOne of Parker's experiments at Horizon accidentally bestowed super powers into an irresponsible teen (Andrew Maguire). As Alpha, Maguire became Spider-Man's arrogant sidekick, with little regard for Spider-Man's concern for his well being. \n\n<HR>\nCheck out others who have used the name \"Spider-Man\" at the [[Spider-Man (disambiguation)|Disambiguation Page]].",

            "bio": "Ororo Monroe is the descendant of an ancient line of African priestesses, all of whom have white hair, blue eyes, and the potential to wield magic. Her mother, N'dare, was an African princess who married American photojournalist David Monroe and moved with him to Manhattan, where Ororo was born.  When Ororo was six months old, she and her parents moved to Cairo, Egypt. Five years later, during the Arab-Israeli conflict, a plane crashed into their home. Ororo's parents were killed, but she survived, buried under rubble near her mother's body. The resultant trauma left Ororo with severe claustrophobia that still affects her today.\n\nOroro managed to escape the rubble of her shattered home with nothing but the tattered clothes on her back and her mother's ancestral ruby.  Homeless and orphaned, Ororo was found by a gang of street urchins who took her to their master, Achmed el-Gibar. Achmed trained Ororo in the arts of thievery and she soon became his prize pupil, excelling in picking both pockets and locks. During her time in Cairo, Ororo picked the pocket of an American tourist.  The man proved no easy mark, however, as he was [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], a powerful mutant telepath who used his abilities to stop the theft.  At that moment, Xavier was psionically attacked by another mutant and Ororo used the opportunity to escape.\n\nYears later, feeling a strong urge to wander south, Ororo left Cairo.  During her travels, Ororo naïvely accepted a ride from a complete stranger and was almost raped by him.  Forced to defend herself, Ororo killed the man.  From that moment, she swore never to take another human life. Ororo wandered for thousands of miles, almost dying during her trek across the Sahara Desert.  Her mutant ability to psionically control the weather emerged soon after, and she was able to use them to rescue [[Black Panther (T'Challa)|T'Challa]], a prince of the African nation of [[Wakanda]], from his would-be kidnappers.  The pair spent much time together,[[Image:Storm small.jpg|left]] however T'Challa's duties as a prince prevented them from further exploring their burgeoning mutual attraction.\n\nFinally, Ororo reached her ancestors' homeland on the Serengeti Plain in Kenya.  She was taken in by an elderly tribal woman named Ainet who taught her to be responsible with her powers.  Ororo soon came to be the object of worship of the local tribes who believed her to be a goddess due to her gift.\n\nYears later, Ororo was forced to battle the threat of a fellow mutant weather manipulator known as Deluge, who sought revenge against humanity.  With the help of several members of the team of mutant heroes known as the [[X-Men]], Deluge was seemingly destroyed and Ororo returned to her life amongst the tribal people.  The X-Men subsequently told their founder, Professor Xavier, about Storm but he declined to contact her at this point, not wanting to shock the young woman with the true nature of her powers.\n\nMonths later, however, Xavier was left with no choice but to recruit Storm and other mutants from around the world into the X-Men in order to rescue his original students from the threat of the sentient island being known as [[Krakoa]].  Xavier explained to Ororo that she was not a \"goddess\", but a mutant, and as such she had a responsibility to use her abilities to help the world just as she had helped the local tribes.  Curious, Ororo accepted Xavier's offer, and was given the codename \"Storm\".\n\nStorm was initially very naive when it came to the customs of the modern world, but her team mate [[Phoenix (Jean Grey)|Jean Grey]] helped educate her in the ways of society and the pair formed a lasting friendship.  Jean was also one of the first X-Men to learn of Storm's claustrophobia after the two women chased a thief into the subway.\n\nAfter serving with the team for many years, Storm was appointed leader of the team following the departure of former leader [[Cyclops (Scott Summers)|Cyclops]] after the apparent death of Jean.  Storm was initially unsure about her new role, but with the support of her team mates she soon became a capable leader.  When Cyclops eventually returned to the team, Storm found herself doubting her leadership abilities once more after a mission she led went wrong.  However, she soon asserted her position, reminding Cyclops that she was now team leader.\n\nLater, after the X-Men were captured and taken into space by the insectoid alien race known as the [[Brood]], Storm fought back but her powers flared out of control.  She discovered that she had been implanted with a Brood egg that would hatch and transform her into one of the aliens.  Now wanting to unleash such an evil into the world, Storm attempted to commit suicide by channeling all of the surrounding stellar energy into her own body, destroying the Brood embryo but leaving her drifting unprotected in space.  She would have died in the vacuum had it not been for a member of the [[Acanti]], a race of space faring whale-like creatures that had been enslaved by the Brood.  The Acanti that saved Storm was revealed to be the caretaker of the soul of his entire race who had lost his mother to the Brood and needed guidance. Storm agreed to let her consciousness guide the young Acanti whilst it healed her damaged body, and, after the Brood were defeated, a restored Storm returned home with the X-Men.[[Image:Storminline.jpg|left]]\n\nSoon after, the X-Men encountered the underground community of mutants known as the [[Morlocks]] who had kidnapped one of their former members, [[Archangel|Angel]].  To save her friends, Storm challenged the Morlock leader [[Callisto]] to a duel and bested her in hand-to-hand combat.  As a result, Storm became leader of the Morlocks and she ordered them to cease their hostilities against the surface-dwelling humans.\n\nWhen the X-Men later traveled to Japan to attend the wedding of their team member [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Wolverine]], Storm first met the ninja named [[Yukio]].  A friend of Wolverine's, Yukio was the most care free spirit that Ororo had ever met and the two became fast friends.  Yukio influenced a major rebellious change in Storm's attitude towards life, and she took to wearing leather and shaved her hair into a Mohawk.\n\nStorm later had her powers accidentally neutralized by a gun invented by the mutant machinesmith named [[Forge]], who took it upon himself to nurse Storm back to health.  During her convalescence, Storm and Forge fell in love but their relationship was cut short after Storm learned Forge had created the device that stripped her of her powers.\n\nStorm subsequently quit the X-Men and returned to Africa where she finally came to terms with losing her mutant ability.  Returning to Cairo, Storm joined Xavier's newest team of young mutants, the [[New Mutants]], in an adventure into the past during which Storm met one of her ancestors who helped the heroes return to their own time.  Storm and the New Mutants were subsequently captured by the Asgardian trickster god [[Loki]] who sought to use Storm in one of his schemes to discredit his half-brother, the thunder god [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]], by restoring her abilities and brainwashing her into believing she was a goddess.  With the aid of the X-Men, Storm was able to reject Loki's gifts, thus thwarting his plan.\n\nStorm returned to the X-Men to find herself being challenged to a duel for leadership of the team by Cyclops.  Despite her still being powerless, she won and Cyclops quit the team.  Soon after, the X-Men and the [[Hellfire Club]] formed an alliance to combat the growing threats against mutants that saw Storm share the position of White King with a reformed [[Magneto (Magnus)|Magneto]].  The alliance was to be short-lived, however, after Storm decided that in order to safeguard their friends and families from their many enemies, the X-Men must fake their deaths and become an underground proactive strikeforce.  Soon Storm realized that she needed her powers restored and so she sought out Forge for his help.  She found Forge's old mentor Nazé instead, who informed her that Forge had been corrupted by his nemesis, the [[Adversary]], and was seeking to destroy the world.  Unbeknownst to Storm, the Adversary had actually corrupted Nazé.  When Storm finally located Forge, she found him atop a mountain seemingly opening a dimensional portal filled with demons.  Storm struck Forge down, and only then realized he had been attempting to close the portal, not open it.  The Adversary then trapped Storm and Forge in the other dimension and seized control of Dallas, warping time and space in order to foment chaos on Earth.\n\nStorm and Forge spent a year on an alternate Earth, during which time they made peace and admitted their love for one another.  Forge used components from his cybernetic leg to fashion a new device that restored Storm's powers which she then used to energize a portal back to their own world.  They rejoined the X-Men in time to defeat the Adversary, imprisoning him at the cost of their own lives.  However, the Omniversal Guardian named [[Roma]] restored the X-Men to life, freeing the Adversary under the notion that there could be no order without chaos.\n\n[[Image:Storm inline .jpg|left]]Soon after, Storm was captured by the crazed scientist known as [[Nanny (cyborg)|Nanny]] who sought to use Storm's abilities in her quest to liberate the world's super-powered children by making orphans of them.  Nanny used her technology to de-age Storm to her pre-teens and strip her memories so as to better sway the mutant to her cause.  However, Storm fought back and overloaded Nanny's device.  Once more a child with no memories of her life as an X-Man, the young Storm returned to her life as a thief.  On one caper, she found herself the target of the psychic being known as the [[Shadow King]] but was saved by a fellow mutant and thief named [[Gambit]].  The pair formed a partnership and, after Storm regained her memories, she took Gambit to meet the X-Men.\n\nStorm was eventually restored to adulthood after the X-Men were captured by agents of the island nation of [[Genosha]] who used mutants as slaves.  Storm underwent the mutate transformation process, however the Genoshan Genegineer and Chief Magistrate were members of a rebel faction.  They restored Storm's body and mind, and the X-Men were able to defeat their aggressors.\n\nSoon after, the X-Men were reformed into two separate strike teams, with Cyclops and Storm as co-leaders.  Forge aided both teams as their resident technician, however this left little time for them to rekindle their relationship.  Forge still asked Storm to marry him, but she hesitated on giving a reply.  Forge was left thinking she did not truly love him and he left before she could respond with a \"yes\".\n\nMonths later, the eternal mutant [[Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur)|Apocalypse]] made a bid for power by gathering together the [[Twelve]], a group of mutants prophesied to usher in a golden age for their kind that counted Storm amongst their number.  Apocalypse was defeated, but not before the ultimate extent of Storm's mutant power was revealed in an alternate future wherein she had evolved into a wholly elemental being.\n\nNot long after, Storm and five of her team mates formed a splinter group of X-Men known as the [[X-Treme X-Men]], cutting all ties with the rest of the team to search for the diaries of the blind mutant seer [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] that mapped the future of mutants.  During a mission in Australia, Storm was reunited with Gambit who sought to obtain her mother's ruby.  It was revealed that the ruby was part of a set that, when empowered, could open a portal between dimensions.  Several of the gems had already gone missing, and Gambit wished to ensure that Storm's ruby remained safe.  At that moment, the other-dimensional warrior named Shaitan attacked, capturing Gambit and stealing the ruby.  Shaitan used the gems and Gambit's mutant ability to empower them, thus opening a portal allowing the armies of his master, [[Khan]], to pass through and invade Earth.\n\nStorm's X-Men opposed the invaders, but she was seriously injured by Madripoor's ruling crimelord [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and was subsequently taken prisoner by Khan himself.  The warlord intended for Storm to be his queen, and commanded his physicians to heal her.  Storm attempted to seduce Khan into calling off his invasion whilst her team mates fought to close the portal.  Khan's other concubines grew jealous of Storm's advances and attempted to kill her.  Despite her injuries, Storm prevailed and escaped, rejoining her team mates as they destroyed the portal.\n\n[[Image:Storm inline.jpg|left]]During her subsequent recuperation, which required her to undertake physical therapy to heal her back and legs, Storm and her team were asked back to the mansion to rejoin the core X-Men team.  Storm declined, however, believing that there was still work for her team to do.  During a world summit to address the increasing hostilities between humans and mutants, Storm offered her X-Men team's services to the United Nations as a global mutant police force, the X-Treme Sanctions Executive.\n\nStorm's first mission would be a solo one as she was charged with infiltrating and exposing an underground slave trading network that forced mutants to fight in gladiator-style arenas.  Soon after, Storm and her team returned to Westchester to help rebuild the mansion following an attack by Magneto and stayed on to continue their new direction. With the XSE, Ororo and her teammates opposed such threats as the Weaponeers and the extradimensional [[Fury]], as well as aiding the Hellfire Club against an attack by rogue member [[Pierce, Donald|Donald Pierce]]. Ororo was captured by the saurian Hauk’ka who amplified her powers with the intent of creating a global hyper-storm to destroy human civilization, but she was freed by her teammate [[Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers)|Rachel]]. Later, Ororo accompanied [[Havok]]’s X-Men team to Africa to investigate animal mutations. Alongside the Black Panther, Ororo and the X-Men opposed Genoshan scientist Doctor Paine and the Russian criminal the Red Ghost, after which Ororo opted to leave the X-Men and remain in Africa.\n\nFollowing the restoration of reality after it was warped by the [[Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff)|Scarlet Witch]], the majority of the world’s mutants lost their powers and Ororo sought to safeguard those mutants remaining in Africa. During her efforts, Ororo was proposed to by the Black Panther. Returning to Wakanda with him, Ororo met his mother and, while contemplating T’Challa’s proposal, learned that her uncle Shetani was responsible for the attacks on African mutants. After confronting him, Ororo met her maternal grandmother and learned more of her family’s history. Subsequently, she accepted T’Challa’s proposal and the pair were married in Wakanda. After their honeymoon, the royal couple embarked on a world tour, meeting with global leaders such as [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]] and [[Sub-Mariner|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] before deciding to form a global alliance to oppose the U.S. Superhuman Registration Act. Arriving in the U.S., T’Challa and Ororo sought a meeting with the President; however, Ororo was required to register as a superhuman before the meeting could proceed. Refusing, Ororo was subsequently targeted for arrest, and alongside her husband opposed [[Sentinels]] and [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] sent to apprehend her. After Iron Man stood down, Ororo and T’Challa opted to remain in the U.S. on a fact-finding mission prior to taking action against the Registration Act.",

            "bio": "After the [[Fantastic Four]] stopped the [[Skrulls]]' attempted invasion of Earth, Skrull Emperor [[Dorrek]] invested vast resources into creating a superbeing of his own. K'lrt, a decorated soldier and warrior of the Skrull empire, was chosen to undergo a process that endowed him with all the powers of the Fantastic Four, except, when powered by an interstellar beam, far stronger.  When the Super-Skrull first confronted the Fantastic Four, he bested them with their own abilities until [[Mister Fantastic]] identified the power source beamed from the Skrulls home planet and created a jamming device, depriving the Super-Skrull of his powers. Then the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]] tripped him into a crater and the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] melted the rock around it to seal him in.  \n\nRealizing their champion's predicament, the Skrulls developed a stronger source of power and beamed it to him. Re-powered, the Super-Skrull, disguised himself as [[Storm, Franklin|Doctor Franklin Storm]], the father of the Invisible Girl and the Human Torch, and again attacked the Fantastic Four. He called himself the Invincible Man, and claimed that he had received his powers in the Skrulls' prison laboratory. But Mr. Fantastic soon discovered the truth and threatened the Skrull homeworld with a fight to the death with the Super-Skrull and a direct atomic attack on their homeplanet.  The Skrulls recalled the Super-Skrull and sent Dr. Storm back, although they first booby-trapped him with an explosive in an attempt to destroy the Fantastic Four. Storm, however, threw himself on the floor and took the brunt of the explosion to save his family and their friends, killing himself.\n\nHis repeated defeats at the hands of the Fantastic Four allowed the Super-Skrull to fall out of favor with his government.  Despite a second chance against the thunder [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]], the Super-Skrull was exiled. \n\n[[image:superSkrull01.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]However, due to the loyalty to his race and his extreme power levels, the Skrulls have usually found they have need of the Super-Skrull, recalling him to service time and again. For example, Dorrek once hoped the Super-Skrull would the Kree [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]), disrupting the Kree from their surveillance of Earth, but Captain Marvel turned Kl'rt's power against him. Another time, he was drafted into the then-ongoing Kree-Skrull War, fighting the [[Avengers]] but hoping to take advantage of the war to increase his own political standing. This time, he was sent into permanent exile for treason. \n\nWorking as a free agent, the Super-Skrull became an agent for [[Thanos]] the mad Titan, running once more into Captain Marvel. This time, his defeat left him stranded on Earth without interstellar transportation. Hoping to power a starship and flee the planet, he tried to steal the Cavourite crystal but was confronted by [[Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers)|Ms. Marvel]] and [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]. The Super-Skrull routed the two, but when he captured the crystal, its energies interfered with those of the interstellar beam that boosted his powers-- he found himself teleported to the Skrull throneworld. Unfortunately, he could never regain his physical form. \n\nThe throneworld soon fell victim to [[Galactus]], and the process of the planet's destruction send the Super-Skrull's disconnected form back to Earth, where it became trapped in the Van Allen Radiation Belts. Eventually, a group of scientists, including Dr. Walter Langkowski, a.k.a. the hero [[Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski)|Sasquatch]], made contact with the Super-Skrull's atoms with their equipment, inadvertantly allowing the Super-Skrull to reincorporate. The Super-Skrull's elation at being free was tempered with the fact that he was now physically dying. As a result of his entrapment within the radiation belts, he had developed a form of leukemia. Sasquatch battled the rampaging Skrull but was ultimately forced to return him to his discorporate state and return it to the Van Allen Radiation Belts once more.\n\nDuring his time of incapacitation, the Skrulls lost their natural shape-changing powers and their empire was decimated into factions. (In fact, K'lrt's wife R'Kll was the assassin who killed the Emperor Dorrek.) One of the self-proclaimed \"Empresses\" of the empire's remnants, [[S'byll]], tricked the [[Silver Surfer]] into using his power cosmic to re-form the Super-Skrull in order that they may aid her fleet in battle against the [[Badoon]]. This act threatened to escalate a new Kree-Skrull war, and the Super-Skrull convinced the Surfer to use his power cosmic to help him catalyze the latent shape-changing powers in S'byll's genetic structure. The two were able to awake the full power of a shape-changing Skrull in S'byll as well as to give her the ability to rekindle the shape-changing powers of others of her race. S'byll was sure that this ability would grant her support for her Empress-ship and allow the Skrulls to defy the Kree's genocidal efforts against the Skrulls. K'lrt stayed on as S'byll's champion, enjoying unparalleled fame as a great hero of the Skrull worlds.\n\nShortly after, the enigmatic [[Stranger]] appeared and tried to add S'byll to his collection. The attempt was foiled when the pirate [[Reptyl|Captain Reptyl]] arrived on the scene and traded his entire pirate crew for her. In return for her freedom, he asked to become a privateer in her cause, and S'byll, happy to find a new ally, accepted his service. Enraged, K'lrt dueled with Captain Reptyl for the honor of being S'byll's consort and the Warlord of the Skrulls. K'lrt lost, and was believed slain, left to drift in space. In fact, the Super-Skrull did not die, but managed to find his way back to Earth where he decided to remain hidden until he could receive orders from a legitimate heir to Emperor Dorrek. \n\nAt one point, the Super-Skrull duplicated the likeness of Danny Rand, a.k.a. [[Iron Fist (Danny Rand)|Iron Fist]], fully assuming his identity in order to use the Rand Corporation and gain economic control of the Antarctic paradise known as the [[Savage Land]]. This conflicted with the plans of another company, Oracle Inc., owned by Prince Namor the [[Sub-Mariner]]. Namor, [[Namorita]], and [[Knight, Misty|Misty Knight]] confronted Super-Skrull, who, with his plans ruined, abandoned Rand's identity and fled. (The assembled heroes set out on a search for the real Danny Rand, eventually freeing him from the alien [[H'ylthri]].)\n\nDuring his time of hiding, he appropriated the identity of Lon Zelig, a master of disguise, and he quickly gained renown in Hollywood. Eventually, he was targeted for assassination by other Skrulls, who believed K'lrt to be a living representative of an old regime and a dangerous potential menace. The Skrulls tricked the Human Torch into fighting alongside them, but K'lrt defeated the attempt and revealed the truth to the Human Torch before disappearing once more.\n\nThe Super-Skrull was impressed into serving a Skrull faction led by the [[Intelligentsia]], a Skrull version of the Kree's [[Supreme Intelligence]]. Although he apparently bristled at her leadership, he followed one of her orders to kidnap Kelly, a girl on Earth who held a special connection to the nexus of all realities. This first brought him into conflict with [[Photon (Genis-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] over her fate, but Kl'rt kidnapped her, rather than killing her as was ordered, and returned to Intelligentsia with her. Hoping to stage a coup, with the girl's powers, the Super-Skrull again fought off Captain Marvel, but Kelly instead turned her power on herself, negating her abilities, rendering the whole thing moot. The Super-Skrull was never seen working with the Intelligentsia again. \n\n[[image:superSkrull02.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]By this time, S'byll had died when her Skrull throneworld was destroyed by [[Devos]]. The Super-Skrull joined a faction of the empire who were seeking an heir to Emperor Dorrek, believing him to be found in Teddy Altman, [[Hulkling]]. Teddy was the product of the union between the original Captain Marvel and [[Anelle|Princess Anelle]], during the time of Marvel's abduction by the Super-Skrull many years ago. Despite the interference of Teddy's friends, the [[Young Avengers]], the Super-Skrull revealed the truth of Teddy's origin and killed his \"mother\", a Skrull sent by the Princess to raise her son on Earth. Teddy was forced to acknowledge his heritage to both the Kree and the Skrulls, dividing his time between the two empires. In fact, unknown to all but the Young Avengers, Kl'rt impersonated Hulking, taking his place and his role in order to spy on the two races. \n\nShortly thereafter, however, the Skrull empire fell victim to the [[Annihilation|Annihilation Wave]], although the Super-Skrull, for all his power, seemed helpless to stave its course. Believing his son to be residing on a planet in its path, Kl'rt and a Skrullian engineer [[R'kin]] hoped to find the secret to stop the Annihilation Wave and its weapon, the [[Harvester of Sorrows]], from its source: the [[Negative Zone]]. Rallying troops from a penal colony within the Zone, the Super-Skrull was instead betrayed by R'kin, who held the Super-Skrull responsible for the death of his father. Imprisoned, Kl'rt used his hypnosis to force R'kin to free him and fellow prisoner [[Praxagora]], the last of a robotic race. The Super-Skrull urged Praxagora to escape, but not before absorbing enough of her energy to make one final stand from within. Kl'rt sacrificed himself destroyed the Harvester, once more proving himself to be a hero for his people. Super-Skrull's body was later revealed to be in possession of Praxagora who had survived the explosion and joined the [[United Front]] against [[Annihilus]]. In one of the battles against Annihilus' forces Super-Skrull's body was reanimated by compination of [[Firelord]]'s and [[Ravenous]]' powers as they unleashed them in the mist of the battle. He stayed with the United Front until the end of the war.\n\nRecently, Ronan called both Kl'rt and Praxagora to Kree space in order to give them awards for their heroics during the war. However the Kree Empire was already infected by the [[Phalanx]]. Somehow the Phalanx had captured both Kl'rt and Praxagora and infected them with their techno-organic virus, causing them to become servants of the Phalanx. However, due to the intervention of the being known as [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]] both Kl'rt and Praxagora were freed from the Phalanx's control.",

            "bio": "A prodigious savant of skills with mnemonic talents psychiatrists called “Photographic Reflexes,” Taskmaster has used his talent to become the Marvel Universe's premier trainer for the criminal world and government. \n\n=== Origin ===\nThe man who would become the Taskmaster was born a prodigious savant of mnemonic talents. <ref>Dark Reign Files #1</ref> He discovered his unusual abilities in childhood when, after watching a cowboy television program, he found he could duplicate the rope tricks he had seen the actors perform. Growing to understand his ability, he saw a man perform a difficult backwards leap from a diving board; he duplicated the dive, but nearly drowned because he didn’t know how to swim. Afterwards, his mother called in psychiatrists who studied his ability, terming it “photographic reflexes.” He employed his talent several times during his youth for professional gain, most notably when he became a star quarterback of his high school football team after watching one pro football game. After graduating high school he contemplated becoming a crimefighter, but decided crime would be more lucrative.\n\n===  Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane ===\nHe then began a program of observing the fighting techniques of various super heroes and their techniques through archival television news broadcasts to expand his combat repertoire. Initially committing several grand larcenies, he decided it was smarter to avoid risking direct confrontation with law enforcers, and used his stolen capital to establish himself as a combat trainer for aspiring professional criminals, specializing in producing henchmen for super villains and criminal organizations around the world. Designing a costume, he took the moniker “Taskmaster”; one unidentified early graduate of his criminal academy would become espionage legend [[Spymaster (spy)|Spymaster]]. <ref>Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11</ref> Taskmaster set up the [[Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane]] as a front for one of his training academies, but its administrator [[Solomon, Pernell|Dr. Pernell Solomon]] developed heart problems and had Taskmaster’s science staff grow him a clone, Selbe, to harvest for a replacement organ; [[Selbe]] escaped and ran to the [[Avengers]], who exposed the operation with the aid of their ally [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]]. Taskmaster single-handedly held his own against both [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)]] and [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]] in combat; while tempted to test himself against all the Avengers, he realized that he would not be able to run his business from jail and fled after the unfamiliar abilities of obscure robotic Avengers associate [[Jocasta]] threw him off balance. <ref>Avengers #196</ref>\n\n=== Early Adventures ===\nAlong with skull-crushing Canadian mercenary [[Farsa, Tyrell|Tyrell Farsa]] and telepathic mind-altering assassin [[Black Swan]], Taskmaster was hired to kill a militant group by an unrevealed country trying to maintain control of an airstrip. Upon completion of the mission, Farsa disrespected the cultured Black Swan by using his silk handkerchief, and Taskmaster assisted Farsa when the Black Swan attacked, but Black Swan defeated them both. <ref>Deadpool #65</ref> Taskmaster briefly joined the criminal [[Frightful Four]] with [[Wizard|Wizard (born Bentley Wittman)]], [[Deadpool (Wade Wilson)|Deadpool (“Wade Wilson”)]] and [[Constrictor]] to battle the [[Fantastic Four]], but when Deadpool went after [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin Richards]], Franklin proved to be more trouble than planned. When the Fantastic Four soon arrived home and Taskmaster, Wizard, and Constrictor left Deadpool to face the Fantastic Four alone, and this Frightful Four grouping disbanded soon after. <ref>Deadpool #35</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Taskmaster went into hiding and continued to training others, including [[Crossbones|Brock Rumlow (later Crossbones]]), [[Anaconda|Blanche Sitznski (later Anaconda)]], [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Rachel Leighton (later Diamondback)]] and [[Snapdragon (Sheoke Sanada)|Sheoke Sanada (later Snapdragon)]]. [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)]] and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]] soon discovered another of Taskmaster’s schools and battled Taskmaster, preventing his theft of nuclear material. <ref>Marvel Team-Up #103</ref> [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)]] and Ant-Man later exposed and halted Taskmaster’s use of the [[Carson Carnival of Traveling Wonders]] as a mobile recruiting center, <ref>Avengers #223</ref> and Spider-Man and [[Nomad (Jack Monroe)]] disrupted his recruiting street gangs for Black Abbott. <ref>Marvel Team-Up #146</ref>After battling the [[Thing (Benjamin Grimm)]] and [[Justice (Vance Astrovik)|Vance Astrovik (later Justice)]] in Ohio, Taskmaster was captured by FBI agents and taken into custody. <ref>Thing #26</ref>\n\nUnder the guise of John Smith, the [[Red Skull (Johann Shmidt)|Red Skull]] manipulated [[Rockwell, Douglas|Douglas Rockwell]], head of [[Commission on Superhuman Activities|CSA (Commission on Superhuman Activities)]], into reducing Taskmaster’s sentence in return for training [[U.S.Agent|John Walker (later USAgent)]] as the next Captain America to disgrace the image of Captain America. <ref>Captain America #334</ref> After completing this assignment, the Red Skull arranged for the Taskmaster’s escape so he could resume his operations. The Skull funded Taskmaster’s activities, and Taskmaster tutored multiple students in Captain America’s fighting style so that the Red Skull could kill them in his own training exercises in order to get his newly cloned body of Captain America in physical fighting shape for a confrontation with the Captain (Captain America, Steve Rogers) and Captain America (U.S. Agent, John Walker). Later, Taskmaster set up a new academy at Brooklyn, New York mausoleum where he battled Spider-Man, who believed Taskmaster had kidnapped his wife, [[Watson, Mary Jane|Mary Jane Watson-Parker]]; using a magnesium flare, Taskmaster escaped both capture and Spider-Man’s wrath.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #308</ref>  When the Spymaster was believed slain, unscrupulous industrialist [[Hammer, Justin|Justin Hammer]] hired Taskmaster to train a replacement. Taskmaster’s lethal elimination tests whittled the candidates down to one winner, [[Spymaster (Nathan Lemon)|Nathan Lemon]]. Taskmaster charged the new Spymaster to retrieve the golden angel ornament from atop of the Christmas tree at [[Stark Enterprises]] as a field test in order to graduate before sending him to Justin Hammer. Iron Man decided to let Spymaster walk away with the prize instead of endangering the lives of children in the area. <ref>Iron Man #254</ref>\n\nTaskmaster briefly put his operations on hold when a faction of the Hand ninja cult created an assassination contest between Taskmaster and [[Tombstone]] to see who could kill the most targets. This led to a battle with vigilantes [[Daredevil (Matt Murdock)]] and [[Punisher (Frank Castle)]]; Taskmaster wound up with the Punisher’s knife in his stomach, and spent some time in a prison hospital recuperating. Taskmaster later resumed operations for the Red Skull and attended an assemblage of Red Skull’s division chiefs, which included [[Watchdog Prime]], [[Sin (Sinthea Shmidt)]], [[Zola, Arnim|Arnim Zola]], [[Minister Blood]], [[Power Broker (Curtiss Jackson)]], a [[Scourge of the Underworld]], the [[Resistants]]’ [[Crucible (Byron Calley)]], the [[Secret Empire]]’s Number Seven and [[Hydra]]’s [[Baron Strucker]]. When Crossbones took a leave of absence from the [[Skeleton Crew]], [[Mother Night]], claiming Red Skull requested the training, had Taskmaster train [[Cutthroat]] as his replacement. \n\nHired by the Red Skull to kill Spider-Man, Taskmaster took this opportunity to try out new graduates [[Blood Spider|Blood Spider (Michael Bingham)]], [[Death-shield|Death-shield (Timothy Karlskin)]], and [[Jagged Bow|Jagged Bow (Joe Emberlin)]], whom he had trained to be criminal versions of Spider-Man, Captain America and Hawkeye. Spider-Man and the anti-terrorist [[Solo (James Bourne)]] defeated the trio as Taskmaster escaped capture once again.\n\nAfterwards, Taskmaster battled the [[Falcon (Sam Wilson)]] when he helped Tyrone McQuaid escape from one of Taskmaster’s academies; attended the [[Brass Bishop (Robert Brasman)]]’s criminal auction in Canada, where he fought Spider-Man and [[Alpha Flight]]; crossed swords with Daredevil, [[Stilt-Man (Wilbur Day)]], [[Tatterdemalion]] and the [[Wild Boys]] over restaurant grease believed to be worth half a million dollars; took on Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (Felicia Hardy)]] during a bank robbery training session; and testified as a character witness when super-criminal [[Trapster (Peter Petruski)]] tried to sue the criminal mechanic Tinkerer for faulty equipment. \n\nWhen the amnesiac Earth-93060 (“[[Ultraforce (Earth-93060)|Ultraforce]]”) heroine [[Siren (Earth-93060)|Siren (Jennifer Pearson)]] was teleported into one of the academies, Taskmaster gave her an audition to join and eventually developed a relationship with her. Taskmaster also discovered that Diamondback, who had joined under the ruse that she desired more training, had double-crossed him by planting explosives around the academy. When the young mutant [[Jolt (Kyi)]], who desired to join Taskmaster’s academy, accidentally triggered one of the explosive devices, Taskmaster had Jolt open a portal large enough for Siren, Jolt and himself to escape. During the journey through the portal, Siren was sent back to her own dimension, Jolt teleported to an unrevealed location, and Taskmaster was pulled forward in time by a dimension-hopping madman as one of many criminals pitted against the Avengers and a distant cosmos’ heroes before being returned to his own time.\n\nTaskmaster later kidnapped computer hacker and arms supplier [[Weasel (Jack Hammer)]] to retain his services, but after Deadpool defeated Taskmaster, Weasel declined this offer, though he offered his services in the future. Seeking his own death, the mysterious [[Architect]], last of the Shining Ones, arranged a contest involving [[Whiplash (Mark Scarlotti)|Blacklash (Mark Scarlotti)]], Boomerang, the mercenary [[Bullet]], [[Bushwacker]], [[Elektra|Elektra Natchios]], [[Fatale]], [[Machete (Alfonso Lopez)]], [[Razor-Fist (Douglas Scott)]], [[Shatterhead]] and [[Zaran, Maximillian|Maximillian Zaran]] to see which was fit to kill him. During the contest, Taskmaster overpowered Elektra using Daredevil’s fighting style, but she later returned and defeated him. \n\nLater, Taskmaster hired [[Albino (Augusta Seger)]], a world renowned biologist specializing in mutagenics (the study of effects of human mutations) to help him duplicate super-powers. Taskmaster employed [[Batroc (Georges Batroc)]], [[Machete (Ferdinand Lopez)|Machete (Ferdinand Lopez, Alfonso’s brother)]], Zaran and [[Oddball (Elton Healey)]], along with androids of [[Beast (Henry McCoy)]], [[Black Panther (T’Challa)]], Captain America, Goliath (Hank Pym), [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)]], Iron Man, [[Quicksilver]], Namor, [[Thor (Thor Odinson)]], and Vision (“Victor Shade”), to analyze the Avengers’ powers, pitting his operatives against several Avengers members. Taskmaster briefly duplicated the powers of the Avengers [[Firestar]] and Justice using Albino’s technology, but he was defeated by the duo and Hawkeye, and his new powers apparently faded. <ref>Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Marksman #1</ref> When the Avengers began using proactive tactics, they targeted Taskmaster’s numerous academies, briefly putting a stop to his operations and denying criminals, terrorists and super villains a valuable resource; however, Taskmaster continued to elude them. <ref>Avengers #38 (2001)</ref>Taskmaster briefly employed Constrictor, [[Titania (Mary MacPherran)|Copycat (disguised as Titania/Mary MacPherran)]] and the “[[Deadpool Interns]]” — [[Deadair]], [[Deadend]], and [[Deadweight]] — to seek revenge on Deadpool. Afterwards, Taskmaster entered Madripoor’s Bloodsport tournament to help boost his price in training super villains, but was defeated by the telepathic mass murderer [[Mister X]].\n\n=== Agency X ===\nTrying to make up for the lost profit, Taskmaster returned to mercenary assignments and accepted [[Bain, Sunset|Sunset Bain]]’s commission to sabotage a semiconductor being built by Tony Stark. Taskmaster completed the assignment, but when Bain tried to have him killed, he tricked Triads gangs into attacking her, ultimately harming her organization enough that she finally called off her hit. During this time he became involved with [[Brandenberg, Sandi|Sandi Brandenberg]], but eventually broke it off; while they remained friends, he found it difficult to give her up. When Deadpool employed Sandi as a secretary, she brought Taskmaster in to aid him against the Black Swan. Taskmaster helped set Deadpool on the path to facing the Black Swan, and he also found time to execute Sandi’s then-boyfriend when he learned he had beaten her. When Deadpool seemingly died in an explosion battling the Black Swan, Sandi believed the amnesiac [[Agent X (Nijo)|Agent X (Alex Hayden)]] was Deadpool, and Taskmaster trained him on Sandi’s behalf, then aided Agent X and [[Outlaw (Inez Temple)]] when the [[Four Winds (Cartel)|Four Winds]] crime family clashed over Agency X’s property. Discovering Agent X was an amalgam of Black Swan's agent Nijo, Deadpool, and Black Swan, they arranged to restore themselves to normal, but when the Black Swan tried to double-cross them, Taskmaster, Outlaw, Sandi and the Eastern Wind helped Deadpool and Agent X defeat Black Swan.\n\n=== Civil War ===\nThe [[Committee]], a cartel of financiers ostensibly dedicated to reviving the US economy through illegal activities, hired Taskmaster to assassinate vigilante [[Moon Knight (Marc Spector)]], who had been instrumental in defeating them in the past, after their agent the [[Profile]] determined that Moon Knight was without friends or determination. Taskmaster found that this was not the case, as Moon Knight’s friends came to aid him, and he tried to get out of his Committee deal, but Moon Knight pursued him to the Committee’s base and defeated him in battle. <ref>Moon Knight #3-6 (2006)</ref>\n\nArrested and imprisoned under unrevealed circumstances, Taskmaster was recruited for government service by the CSA during the “Civil War” between US super heroes following passage of the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA). Assigned to the [[Thunderbolts]], Taskmaster joined other superhuman criminals in attacking Captain America’s anti-SHRA forces. Following Cap’s surrender, Taskmaster was re-arrested, but before being transferred to the [[Negative Zone]] prison 42 he was quickly released by Deadpool, who had hoped to re-establish his reputation by defeating Taskmaster in a public display of combat. <ref>Civil War #1-6</ref>\n\n=== Initiative ===\nSHIELD Commander [[Hill, Maria|Maria Hill]] gave Taskmaster a full presidential pardon after he helped test the defenses of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Helicarrier. The CSA then recruited him to train three clones of accidentally slain Fifty State Initiative cadet [[MVP]] in Spider-Man’s fighting style so they could become Initiative agents as the [[Scarlet Spiders]]. Afterwards, Taskmaster was assigned to [[Camp Hammond]] as the Fifty State Initiative recruit drill instructor, where his many students included [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)]], [[Bengal (Duc No Tranh)]], [[Cloud 9 (Abigail Boylen)]], [[Crusader (Z'reg)]], [[Dragon Lord]], [[Geiger]], [[Komodo (Melati Kusama)]], [[Melee]], [[Rage]], [[Red 9]], [[Speedball (Earth-8101)|Speedball (Earth-8101)]]’s simian Robbie Baldwin), [[Stature]], [[3-D Man (Delroy Garrett)|Triathlon]] and [[Ultragirl]]. Later, super-criminals [[Firebrand (Russ Broxtel)]], [[King Cobra (Klaus Voorhees)]], [[Mauler (Brendan Doyle)]] and [[Mister Hyde]] made a failed attempt to kill the Taskmaster for joining the Initiative. When inept Initiative recruit [[Butterball]] was sent home, Taskmaster and Constrictor felt sorry for him and arranged a photo where it looked like Butterball defeated the pair in combat.\n\nAfter the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], the Initiative fell under the control of corrupt, unstable tycoon [[Osborn, Norman|Norman Osborn]]; he restructured it, assigned Taskmaster to the [[Shadow Initiative]] along with Bengal, Constructor, Komodo and [[Typhoid Mary|Mutant Zero]], and sent them to Madripoor to apprehend Initiative defector [[Hardball (Roger Brokeridge)]], who had joined Hydra. Completing the mission, the Shadow Initiative returned home to find Osborn replacing Camp Hammond with his new [[Camp HAMMER]]. Osborn placed Taskmaster and supernatural crime boss the [[Hood (Parker Robbins)]] in charge of the Initiative and began welcoming many active super-criminals into the organization. These new recruits were supposedly reformed, but Osborn would allow them to continue their criminal careers in secret as long as they posed as heroes in public, so Taskmaster and Hood trained many of these criminals in how to fake heroic behavior. Meanwhile, Taskmaster secretly helped Deadpool battle Osborn’s Thunderbolts as payback for Deadpool previously having helped Taskmaster escape prison.",

            "bio": "On Saturn's moon of Titan lived a colony of [[Eternals]], and Thanos was born as one of the last sons of the original colonists, [[Mentor (Alars)|Mentor]] and [[Sui-San]]. However, he was born misshapen and monstrous in comparison to the other Eternals, particularly his handsome and carefree brother, [[Starfox]], and Thanos grew into a melancholy, brooding individual, consumed with the concept of death. More than any of his people, Thanos sought out personal power and increased strength, endowing himself with cybernetic implants until he became more powerful than any of his brethren. At some point, he was exiled from his community, although the accounts differ as to its cause. Some say it was because he committed a crime by being the first to create a weapon. Thanos himself once claimed that he vivisected his own mother in an attempt to investigate how someone consumed with death such as himself could have come into being. \n\nGrowing in power and infamy as he traveled the universe, Thanos once met [[Death (embodiment)|Death]] itself, as it appeared to him embodied in a female form. Thanos was infatuated with the being, and endeavored to make himself worthy in order to earn her love in return. With an army under his command, he nearly destroyed his former home of Titan, declaring himself its ruler. He then sought out the powerful [[Cosmic Cube]], and a number of Earth's heroes assembled to confront him. With the Cube's power, Thanos made himself unto a god, and he easily fought back [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Avengers]]. However, Captain Marvel managed to convince Thanos that he had drained the Cube of its power, and the mad Titan discarded it. This allowed Mar-Vell to grab the Cube and restore the universe to its rightful order and drain Thanos of his power. Thanos was shunted back to where he had first launched his bid for power, and was rescued by his starship, Sanctuary II. \n\nThanos believed that Death had rejected him after his failure with the Cosmic Cube, and so he began searching the universe for the powerful [[Infinity Gems|Soul Gems]], one of which was used by [[Warlock, Adam|Adam Warlock]]. Thanos had also learned of the threat of the [[Magus (Adam Warlock)|Magus]], a future version of Adam Warlock who would threaten Thanos' own plans.  Thanos was determined to make sure that the future of the Magus would never occur. Using time travel, he created a perfect pawn for his future struggle-- the deadliest woman in the universe. He rescued [[Gamora]] as an infant and trained her to be his personal assassin. He also joined forces with Adam Warlock to oppose the Magus, who was using his world-conquering [[Universal Church of Truth]] to create a fanatical empire. With this alliance, Thanos helped  ensure that Warlock would never become the Magus, and at the same time, he managed to absorb certain energies of Warlock's Soul Gem that would help him in his subsequent plot.\n\n[[image:thanos01.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]\nOne by one, Thanos collected five other Soul Gems, combining them all in a huge, single, synthetic Soul Gem. He then began to extinguish the very stars themselves, hoping thereby to extinguish all living things in tribute to Death. Thanos was opposed by [[Gamora]], but he slew her as well as [[Pip the Troll]], who was looking for Adam Warlock. Warlock had learned of Thanos' activity and recruited Captain Marvel and the Avengers to again oppose the mad Titan.\n\nCaptain Marvel managed to destroy the synthetic Soul Gem, but Thanos captured the Avengers and even killed Adam Warlock after an intense one-on-one battle. [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] was on hand to help rescue the heroes, and with the help of [[Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]], restore Warlock to life. Warlock's resurrection flushed him with cosmic power and he again engaged in battle with Thanos, who was defeated, but not killed. The Eternal was turned to immobile stone-- an ironic punishment since the lover of Death would be forever denied its embrace.  \n\nDeath did in fact come to visit Thanos, however. It revived him and endowed him with even more power, leading him to believe the universe was unbalanced in terms of life and death and that Thanos was needed to restore that balance. Thanos then proceeded to reassemble the Soul Gems, now called the Infinity Gems, and created the powerful Infinity Gauntlet. With a mere thought, Thanos was able to wipe out half of the universe's population of living beings, and once again he had enough power to make himself an omnipotent being. Many of Earth's heroes and heroes from around the galaxy came to oppose him, and they were joined by other abstract entities who knew Thanos' new powers made him a threat to all existence. Thanos again defeated them all. Ultimately, however, Death spurned him, as Thanos' powers had placed him at a level beyond. Thanos was distraught, and this momentary lapse allowed [[Nebula]], who Thanos was toying with for having assumed to have been related to him, to gain control of the Infinity Gauntlet. Thanos was forced to join with Warlock and the other heroes, and Warlock ended up with the Infinity Gauntlet, restoring the universe to its natural state before Thanos' interference, and Warlock divided the Gems among various guardians who became the [[Infinity Watch]]. \n\nThanos himself was exiled by Warlock to an uninhabited planet, and he set himself up as a simple farmer, seemingly content to spend the rest of his days as a hermit. However, perhaps because of his new lot in life, Thanos was able to sense that [[Eternity]] itself had become catatonic. He sought out Adam Warlock and the Infinity Watch, traveling to the realm of Death to discover that Magus had returned and, by using the power of five Cosmic Cubes, was attempting to recreate reality into a twisted, evil version of itself. During the course of the battle, Magus managed to gain the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. Thanos then confronted Magus, revealing that the Gauntlet was never at its full power, as it used a fake Reality Gem. This allowed Magus to be defeated by Eternity and [[Infinity]], and the Infinity Gems were once more separated to their original guardians. (In fact, Thanos had been the guardian of the Reality Gem, although only Adam Warlock knew of this.)\n\nBut whereas the Magus was the embodiment of Warlock's \"evil side\", a threat still remained with the [[Goddess]], Warlock's \"good side\" that was created, like Magus, when Warlock held the [[Infinity Gauntlet]]. The Goddess gained control of the five Cosmic Cubes and was using them to impose a self-righteous \"order\" upon the galaxy, which included trapping Thanos and Warlock in a shifting reality. Warlock freed them, and, as part of his plan, gave Thanos his Soul Gem to confront the Goddess. Thanos led many of the galaxy's heroes against the Goddess, but it seemed to prove a senseless slaughter-- all were killed. The Goddess then proceeded to destroy the universe, but this destruction (and the slaughter of Thanos and the heroes) were part of an elaborate hallucination created by Warlock. Thanos destroyed the \"Cosmic Egg\" that held the Cosmic Cubes, stopping the Goddess and restoring the universe to normal. \n\nThanos could not wander the universe without growing restless. He sought out the cosmic Oracle using temporary pawns of a [[Super-Skrull]], [[Nitro]], the [[Rhino (Aleksei Sytsevich)|Rhino]], and the [[Titanium Man (Boris Bullski)|Titanium Man]], using it to discover the existence of [[Tyrant]]. He joined [[Ganymede]], [[Jack of Hearts]], and [[Photon (Genis-Vell)|Legacy]] in opposing [[Tyrant]], convincing them that his power would be needed to defeat him. Tyrant, however, confronted the group almost immediately. During the conflict, Thanos revealed that he was after the source of Tyrant's power, a sphere of energy that was siphoned from [[Galactus]]' Herald, [[Morg]]. Thanos further explained Tyrant's origin, battling him while the rest of the heroes escaped. Tyrant was apparently defeated, and Thanos emerged from the destruction wrought by the battle, but without the prize he had sought.\n\nThe [[Silver Surfer]], long since Thanos' enemy, had come to believe that Death was seeking him out to be a new consort. The Surfer approached Thanos with this concern, but Thanos flew into a rage, attacking the Surfer and killing him. Although he appeared to offer the Surfer's body as a sacrifice, Thanos returned the Surfer to life as an insult. Death retaliated by declaring Thanos to be immortal and thus forever denied entering her realm. \n\nLater, Thanos was trapped in a pocket of reality. [[Plunder, Parnival|Parnival Plunder]], brother of [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]], stumbled onto Thanos' reality after contacting the being [[Consumption]], and Thanos set up Parnival to be his pawn. Under Thanos' advice, Parnival created machines that would destroy the [[Savage Land]], but in fact, Thanos absorbed the energy that was released by the machines so that he might open more portals and escape to normal reality. Ka-Zar discovered the truth and battled Thanos directly, and Thanos was toppled into a volcano through one of the portals. He managed to remain stuck in his pocket dimension, however, although he tried to get out by using first the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] and then [[X-Man]] as mental vessels. The two fought each other due to Thanos' influence, and although the villain managed to return to Earth after such a climactic battle, the two turned on Thanos and forced him to return to the pocket reality once more. \n\nNevertheless, Thanos managed to free himself at some point, as he appeared in [[Asgard]], searching for the \"Designate\", a being of phenomenal cosmic power said to play a major role in the cosmic scheme of eternity. He found allies in [[Tarakis]] and the monstrous [[Mangog]], using Mangog to lay waste to the planet Rigel in order to collect the final ingredients to find the Designate. Thanos found her in the person of [[Thor Girl|Tarene]], but was confronted by [[Thor (Thor Odinson)|Thor]] and his allies, a Rigellian recorder android and [[Firelord]]. All the signs began to fall into place, and Thanos nearly gained the power of Ragnarok-- the end of the world-- as evidenced by Thanos' destruction of an unknown but inhabited planet. However, Thanos fell under the attack of Thor and his allies, and Tarene wept again for the lives of those slain by Thanos. Her tears seemed to destroy him, causing him to burst into an all-consuming hellfire, seeming vanquished forever. \n\n[[image:thanos02.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]\nAbout this time, Thanos had rejected Death outright, regarding himself as a death god and hoping to perform acts in his own name and not that of another's. Soon, a star appeared to announce the maturation of the [[Quoi|Celestial Messiah]], a being of some cosmic significance. Thanos left to destroy [[Mantis]], his mother and the Celestial Madonna, regarding her and her son to be antithetical to his own self-styled godhood. Instead, Mantis managed to restore herself to god-like status, thwarting Thanos and \neliciting help from an assemblage of Avengers and their ally, [[Haywire (Earth-712)|Haywire]], to find Quoi before Thanos. As part of his quest, Thanos encountered the space pirate [[Reptyl]] and the alien [[Primo]], imbuing them with power and calling them gods so as to create a pantheon of his own design. The Avengers and Mantis worked to defeat Thanos's efforts to kill Quoi, and in the process discovered the cosmic [[Rot]], a state of un-being that threatened the existence of Eternity. Thanos and the others were forced to work together to defeat the Rot, and ultimately Death itself appeared, telling them of the Rot's true origin as an offspring of Death and Thanos, created when Thanos first died and entered Death's metaphysical embrace. Thanos and Death worked together to destroy the Rot. Thanos ultimately fled, distraught over his role in creating the Rot in the first place and refusing to accept Death's rekindled interest in him.\n\nAt some point, Thanos had begun creating duplicates of himself that later became known as the [[Thanosi]], each with its own unique aspect that was heightened through scientific and/or mystical means. These genetic duplicates were kept in stasis, however, when Thanos had no need to test himself against them. An errant meteor freed a number of them, and due to the nihilistic vision they shared with their master, they took it upon themselves to seek out the cosmic \"anchor\" being that kept the universe fixed in its cosmic position and prevented its fall into the void of Final Oblivion. In their search, they were opposed by Warlock, Pip the Troll, Gamora, and others, including Thanos himself. In fact, the anchor being, [[Atlez]], had himself freed Thanos' duplicates in order that Warlock would be drawn into the conflict and search out his replacement, who was born too early but destined to be the next anchor being. The duplicates were defeated and Atlez' replacement was found in time to prevent the Final Oblivion, and the universe was ultimately restored to its natural state.\n\nFollowing these events, there appeared the powerful Ankhenaten, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh who sought out the mystical object known as the Heart of the Universe, from which all energy physical and metaphysical emanates, and thereby gained infinite power. Several heroes tried to stop Ankhenaten's rampage, and the conflict gathered Thanos, Galactus, and other cosmic beings as well. Through a mixture of guile and power, Thanos stole the Heart of the Universe, merging with it to make himself like unto a god. First defeating Ankhenaten in ancient Egypt, Thanos remade the universe as if Ankhenaten never appeared, although Thanos remained omnipotent. A cabal of cosmic beings of power, such as Eternity and the [[Living Tribunal]] prompted an assembly of nearly every super-being, god, and cosmic entity (such as Galactus and the Celestials) help take Thanos down. Dismissing them all, Thanos proved to be too powerful. He could even kill a Celestial with but a glance! Thanos decided that the true sign of his ultimate power would be to destroy the universe and become the one true supreme being. However, after doing so, he realized that this role was ultimately hollow, unfulfilling and empty, not to mention unnatural. He subsequently undid the destruction of the universe and obliterated the Heart from existence. Thus, not only did he strip himself of power, but he made the entire series of events null and void.",

X-23's natural healing also affords her virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs, as well as an enhanced resistance to diseases and the fatigue poisons generated by bodily activity. Hence, her endurance, agility and reflexes are enhanced. X-23 also possesses superhumanly acute senses, allowing her to see and hear things at an extended distance.

As revenge for her insubordination, Rice forced Kinney to act as the surrogate mother for the clone, and she gave birth to \"X-23.\"\n\n\n[[image: x-2301.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]Raised in captivity, X-23 was trained to be a weapon. Kinney did her best to ensure the child retained some semblance of humanity, but her efforts appeared to be in vain. After seven years, Rice had X-23 subjected to radiation poisoning in order to accelerate the activation of her mutant gene, then forcibly extracted her claws and coated them with Adamantium. Next, Rice created a chemical compound he called \"trigger scent\" that sent X-23 into an involuntary berserker rage upon smelling its presence. Three years later, X-23 was sent on her first field mission to kill Presidential candidate Greg Johnson. Numerous other missions followed, as X-23's services were sold to the highest bidder, and she was left emotionally stunted as a result. Rice, in an attempt to avenge his father's murder, abandoned X-23 on a particularly dangerous mission, but she survived against overwhelming odds and managed to return to the facility.\n\nUltimately, Rice persuaded Sutter to hand over control of the program to him, then secretly ordered X-23 to kill Sutter and his family. Later, Rice revealed to Kinney a chamber with dozens of incubation pods containing female clones before he fired her. Before fleeing the facility with X-23, Kinney gave her one last mission - destroy the pods and kill Rice. However, Rice was able to exact revenge on Kinney from beyond the grave, as he had earlier exposed her to the trigger scent, sending X-23 into a rage that caused her to kill her mother. As she lay dying, Kinney named X-23 Laura.\n\n[[image: x-2302.jpg|left|200px|thumb]]X-23 surfaced in New York two years later and was found living on the streets by a pimp named [[Zebra Daddy]], who took her in and employed her as a prostitute. During her time as a prostitute, X-23 seemed to suffer from a self-mutilating disorder. She superficially cut herself with her own claws whenever she was in a threatening situation. She also seemed to suffer some personality issues which left her mostly mute and unable to free herself from the grip of Zebra Daddy. X-23 started to come to her senses after she met [[Nixon, Kiden|Kiden Nixon]], a young mutant with the ability to freeze [[Glossary:T#time|time]] when in danger, and together with Kiden's teacher, they rescued another young mutant, the feral [[Catiana]], from an angry mob. Zebra Daddy tracked X-23 down, but with the aid of her newfound friends and the mutant named [[Felon]], Zebra Daddy's thugs were defeated. X-23 then killed him to save the lives of her friends. X-23 later took a job at the mutant-themed Wannabee's nightclub in the [[Mutant Town]] district of New York. It was there that she saved the life of the daughter of mob boss Don Parisi from a gang of thugs, whom she killed. The deaths inadvertently implicated Wolverine, prompting his teammates in the [[X-Men]] to investigate. X-23 instinctually attacked Wolverine on sight, but he was eventually able to calm her down, and she led the X-Men to Parisi's daughter. After aiding the X-Men against Parisi's super-strong mutant enforcer [[Geech]], X-23 fled the scene. She later returned to help the X-Men save victims of a car accident, after which she was enrolled at the X-Men's [[Xavier Institute For Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]].\n\nX-23 quickly became very protective of Wolverine, attacking his teammate [[Bishop (Lucas Bishop)|Bishop]] after he felled Wolverine during a training session. She also took to observing Wolverine on the mansion's security monitors. During one such viewing, an anomalous energy spike prompted X-23 to investigate. Encountering [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] at the source of the signal, X-23 initially mistook him for an enemy and attacked. The pair ultimately teamed up to save the young mutant [[Patterson, Paul|Paul Patterson]] from an [[Glossary:A#Alternate Earth|alternate reality]] version of the armored [[Avengers|Avenger]] [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]]. The arrival of the heroic [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] and the super-spy [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] helped turn the tide. X-23 then secretly followed Wolverine on his investigation of strange activity in the Canadian Rockies. Ambushed by the Hauk'ka, evolved Saurians from the [[Savage Land]], X-23 managed to escape and alert the X-Men. Traveling to the Savage Land, X-23 and the X-Men teamed with the Land's lord [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] and his circumstantial allies, the [[Savage Land Mutates]], to prevent the Hauk'ka from destroying human civilization by controlling the weather-manipulating X-Man [[Storm]].\n\nSometime later, X-23 turned up in the in two other X-titles, without her friends. She was accused of the murders of four [[Humans|humans]] that were investigated by Wolverine and his fellow X-Men. (While she was responsible for the murders, she committed them because the victims were brutally attacking a young woman.) After a brief conflict with the mutant [[Glossary:S#super hero|heroes]], X-23 came to live with them at the Xavier Institute. She has nearly no social skills, so Wolverine is helping her adjust to her new life. She seems to be making friends with [[Pryde, Kitty|Shadowcat]], [[Psylocke]], and [[Marvel Girl (Rachel Summers)|Rachel Summers]]. X-23 was approached by the [[Glossary:C#cosmic|cosmic]] Uni-Power in hopes of making specific use of her healing ability. Although she initially resisted its attempts to bond with her, and she remained reluctant even though it pleaded with her, she ultimately agreed to aid it and became Captain Universe for a brief time.\n\n[[Image:x23target.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]After the effects of [[House of M|\"M-Day\"]], X-23 was one of the few students who didn't lose their powers. The depowered students and staff were sent home; however their bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot [[Stryker, William|Reverend William Stryker]]. Subsequently, [[Frost, Emma|Emma Frost]] had the surviving students engage in an all-in brawl, with those deemed to be the best performers assigned to a new team of trainee X-Men. Despite Frost's attempts to omit her, X-23 was among those students who made the grade.\n\n\nShortly afterwards, following Stryker's attack on the ex-mutant students, X-23 heard [[Dust]] talking to [[Icarus (Jay Guthrie)|Icarus]], who had fled the Mansion. Dust intended to meet Jay, but Laura told her it was a trap, and had to knock out her roommate to keep her safe. Donning Dust's burkha X-23 came to Stryker's compound and was shot. After a few minutes spent healing and playing possum, Laura returned to the Mansion to help fend off Stryker and his goons.\n\nThe team gave more respect to Laura following her part in stopping Stryker's attack, in which she single-handedly killed three Purifiers. Following that she started to bond with her friends, using her enhanced hearing to find out what happened to Icarus for them, learning that Stryker killed him.\n\nAfter Surge received a distress call from [[Forge]], X-23 followed the team along to Dallas to rescue him from the [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] [[Nimrod (Sentinel)|Nimrod]]. At the height of the desperate battle she managed to cut through to the interior of the machine with her claws, allowing the Sentinel to be defeated. She was wounded during the battle and was unable to heal herself. In order to save X-23, [[Hellion|Julian]] supercharged his [[Glossary:T#telekinetic|telekinetic]] powers with the help of Emma Frost in order to rush her back to the mansion where she was healed by [[Elixir]]. As Hellion recovered his strength, and found that his power levels were enhanced, Laura kept watch over him. Emma Frost confronted Laura, asking her to leave the school because of the trigger scent saying that she was a danger to everyone at the institute even Julian. Their conversation is cut short by Cessily ([[Mercury]]) coming to Laura's defense. Mercury persuades Laura to go for coffee and discuss Laura's crush on Julian. However, the cafe is attacked by [[Kimura]] and her minions. though Laura thought that Kimura was after her, she was really after Cessily.\n\nLaura goes back to the Xavier Institute when Hellion interrupts her as she is gearing up to attack against the facility. He informs her that he is coming with her. The two find a hide out where Laura interrogates a man at gun point. Upon securing the information she needs, X-23 shoots him in the head. Julian is shocked and tells her that killing will no longer be a part of their interrogation technique, X-23 remains silent and the two continue their search for the facility.",

            "bio": "Carol Danvers entered the Air Force upon graduating from high school to pursue her love of aircrafts and her dreams of flying. Carol was a top student at the Air Force Academy and enjoyed a rapid career advancement rising to the rank of Major. Because of her stellar performance, superb combat skills and natural intellect, Carol was recruited into the intelligence field. She ended up serving with the C.I.A., during which time she met and worked with Colonel [[Fury, Nick|Nick Fury]]. She was partnered with Colonel Michael Rossi and the two became lovers. Carol had a distinguished career in the C.I.A. \n\nWhile on special assignment with Nick Fury, Carol met the Canadian agent called [[Wolverine (James Howlett)|Logan]]. The two were eventually paired up and shared a number of adventures together. During one of their infamous escapades, they clashed with the brutal [[Sabretooth]] who was working for the [[Hellfire Club]]. During their time together, Logan and Carol became close friends, perhaps even lovers. Both have saved each other’s lives numerous times. \n\nWhen Carol was captured by the KGB and imprisoned at Lubyanka prison, Logan was among those who defied their orders so she would be free. Following her affiliation with the C.I.A., Carol took a position with N.A.S.A. as the security director for Cape Canaveral. It was in this capacity that Carol first met [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]], the [[Kree]] warrior, Mar-Vell. In her official capacity, Carol was challenged with unraveling the mystery of this alien soldier. During her investigation, the two forged a unique bond, first as friends and then as lovers. It was this relationship that would change Carol forever. \n\nCaptain Marvel's mortal enemy, Colonel [[Yon-Rogg]] kidnapped Carol, using her as bait in his conflict with Mar-vell. In the course of the battle, Carol and Mar-vell were caught in the explosion of a Kree [[Psyche-Magneton]] device. The energy bombardment somehow caused Carol’s genetic structure to be melded with Mar-vell's. While Mar-vell was apparently unaltered by the event, Carol was now a perfect hybrid of Kree and human genes. In addition, she possessed all of Mar-vell's Kree knowledge and training. Through this transformation, Ms. Marvel was born. \n\nBecause of her failure to capture Captain Marvel, Carol lost her job at N.A.S.A. She recovered quickly, writing a successful novel about her experience in the space industry. This lead to her landing a position as the editor of WOMAN magazine, a subsidiary of the [[Daily Bugle (Building)|Daily Bugle]]. Carol’s viewpoints as a staunch feminist created tensions with her boss [[Jameson, J. Jonah|J. Jonah Jameson]], but made her the perfect choice to be WOMAN magazine’s editor. \n\nJust as Carol was beginning this new chapter of her life, the powers and persona of Ms. Marvel began to emerge. At first, Carol experienced blackouts triggered by Ms. Marvel’s precognitive seventh sense and the two personas were very distinct, both mentally and physically. As time went on and Carol came to accept her new role as Ms. Marvel, the two personalities merged. A second exposure to the energies of a Kree Psyche-Magnetron also imbued Ms. Marvel with some of the properties which formally resided in her Kree uniform (namely flight and the ability to change into costume at will). \n\nCarol fought many villains during her career as Ms. Marvel, including [[Deathbird]], [[MODOK]], [[A.I.M.]], the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], the Hellfire Club, and [[Mystique]]. She also joined the [[Avengers]] for a brief period, and it was this affiliation which drew Carol to the attention of [[Marcus]]. The son of [[Immortus]], Marcus observed the Avengers from afar and became obsessed with Ms. Marvel. Marcus kidnapped Carol using Immortus' technology to manipulate her mind and seduce her into loving him. Marcus impregnated Carol with a child who would rapidly grow up into Marcus himself, enabling him to escape [[Limbo]]. He returned Carol to the Avengers, unaware of her time and seduction in Limbo. Carol was shocked when she learned that she was pregnant and devastated since she was completely unaware of the identity of the father. The pregnancy ran its course in a matter of days, leaving Carol shaken - both as a woman and a hero. The child grew within a day into a full-grown man, one who was determined to win his \"mother’s\" love. Carol, still bewildered by the entire experience, agreed to accompany Marcus back to Limbo. The Avengers wished the pair well. In Limbo, Marcus continued to age rapidly and quickly died of old age, leaving Carol alone in Limbo and free of his mind control. Carol was sickened by Marcus' manipulations and felt betrayed by the Avengers who failed to question Marcus` actions or motives. \n\nCarol mastered Immortus' technology and returned to Earth, choosing to settle in San Francisco instead of returning to the Avengers. Carol’s return to Earth was sensed by the precognitive [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]. Destiny had previously prophesied that Ms. Marvel would be involved in an event that would destroy the life of Mystique's foster daughter, [[Rogue]]. Mystique had vowed to destroy Ms. Marvel before this could happen and developed an obsessive hatred for Ms. Marvel. Rogue, overhearing Destiny’s concerns and Mystique's ranting, decided to take the battle to Carol herself. Rogue attacked Carol in San Francisco and the pair fought atop the Golden Gate Bridge. When Rogue tried to use her power-absorbing abilities on Carol, something went terribly wrong, and she absorbed too much of Carol’s persona, making the transferal permanent. Driven mad by Carol’s thoughts and memories, Rogue threw Carol’s body from the bridge. Amazingly, Carol was rescued by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. At the hospital, Carol was identified and diagnosed as a <i>tabula rasa</i> - a blank slate. Jessica Drew called in [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]] of the [[X-Men]], who was able to pull forth Carol’s memories and personality from her subconscious. However, he was unable to restore her emotional connection to those memories and experiences. Carol and Jessica spent some time at the X-Mansion while Carol recovered from her ordeal. \n\nDuring this time, a now-powerless Carol confronted the Avengers and vented her anger for their betrayal of her. Carol remained with the X-Men for a brief time, during which she often accompanied them on missions. One such mission led to Carol’s capture by the alien [[Brood]]. Fascinated by her Kree/Human physiology, the Brood performed experiments on Carol’s genetic structure. This unleashed the full potential of Carol’s Kree/Human physiology transforming her into the cosmic-powered Binary. Carol now possessed more power than ever due to her link to a white hole. \n\nCarol returned with the X-Men and was strongly considering joining them on a permanent basis when the desperately troubled Rogue came to Xavier for help. Upon seeing Rogue, Carol flew into a rage and punched her into orbit. The X-Men reluctantly informed Carol that Xavier had allowed Rogue to join the X-Men. Unable to accept this, Carol opted to join the space pirates known as the [[Starjammers]] and to leave her troubles on Earth behind. As Binary, Carol was a valued member of the Starjammers and fought alongside them to restore [[Lilandra]] to the [[Shi'ar]] throne. In space, Carol was able to escape her loss and rebuild her life. The stars were her escape and offered her a whole universe in which to escape the emptiness her former life represented. Carol remained with the Starjammers for a number of years. During this time, she lived out her lifelong dream of exploring the stars. She formed a close friendship with [[Raza|Raza Longknife]], the sullen cyborg member of the Starjammers. Despite fighting the Shi'ar forces and her former enemy Deathbird, Carol found herself frustrated at the lack of challenge among the Starjammers' adversaries. When Earth's sun was threatened, Carol chose to abandon her mission for the Shi'ar Majestrix Lilandra Neramani and aid the Avenger [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] in saving it. This effort left Carol in a depleted state, and she spent months recuperating at the [[Avengers Mansion]]. During this time, she reconciled with the Avengers. When the Starjammers came to Earth and into conflict with the Avengers, Carol helped resolve the conflict and decided to try and rebuild her life on Earth. \n\nRecently, Carol rechristened herself Warbird and rejoined the Avengers, following a reality-warping conflict with [[Morgan Le Fay]]. She brought with her a whole new set of problems. First, her powers were slowly depleting, and she attempted to hide this fact from the Avengers, leading to a conflict with [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]]. Carol had also developed a drinking problem, which was immediately noticed by recovering alcoholic and fellow Avenger, [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]]. Her drinking, coupled with her determination to prove herself a worthy addition to the Avengers and her secretiveness about her power loss, led to reckless grand-standing and sloppy teamwork. This eventually endangered the lives of her teammates and led to a formal court-martial before her fellow Avengers. Rather than face her problems and a forced demotion to reserve status, Carol quit the team. This all occurred amidst the Avengers' conflict with a rebel faction of Kree. Seeking to join the battle despite leaving the team, Carol realized that she no longer had the capability to reach escape velocity in order to join the battle on the Moon between the Avengers and the Kree [[Lunatic Legion]]. \n\nDisheartened, Carol realized that she’d hit rock bottom, and moved to Seattle to work on rebuilding her career as a freelance writer and novelist. She started to make some progress in accepting her alcoholism but refused to accept that she had a serious problem for months. After her drinking almost led to disaster in a number of combat situations, Carol was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. Carol’s doctor warned that she had done considerable damage to her internal organs and that another drink might kill her. This diagnosis combined with the knowledge that she had nearly killed a plane full of people during a drunken rage have forced Carol to admit the severity of her drinking problem. Carol has now accepted that she is an alcoholic and has started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on a regular basis. She has since been accepted into the ranks of the Avengers once more and taken the name “Ms. Marvel” once again. \n\nWhen the [[Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff)|Scarlet Witch]] warped [[House of M|reality]], Carol was one of the few people who remembered the events when reality was restored, and she determined to prove her worth as a true hero, something she had experienced during the events. She told this to Captain America when he offered her membership in the new Avengers team, but she declined, feeling unready to join that august assemblage. Cap assured her that a place would always be available to her in the Avengers. Carol was called in to help the New Avengers when the Collective attacked. She fought with it and had her powers reset to her Binary powers, she could then face him on a more equal level so the creature removed her Binary powers again. Later her she helped with the final battle in Genosha, where she helped absorb the massive energy released when Daisy Johnson hit Magneto with a pinpoint earthquake at his chest.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Carol signed the Superhuman Registration Act and joined the Pro-reg forces. Iron man assigned Carol, Wonder man and Arachne with hunting un-registered heroes. They brought in the Prowler and Arana; who Ms. Marvel took under her wing. They later discovered Arachne was working with un-registered heroes and pursued her and her partner, the Shroud. Carol was forced to take down Arachne in front of Arachne's daughter, which left Carol and Arana distraught.    \n\n{{person",

            "bio": "[[Duckworld]], a planet in another dimension where intelligent life evolved from waterfowl, resembles Earth in an astounding number of ways, including the fact that ducks speak English. (In fact, Howard mistook [[Earth]] for Duckworld on his arrival, until he saw the “hairless apes” wandering around.) Howard was born the eldest son of Dave and Dottie, but beyond enjoying his rocking horse on Christmas as a baby, he disappointed them in every other way. He couldn’t hold down any job, be it serious or frivolous, and couldn’t fit in to any group. Instead, he figured he had no use for society, despite his ability to adapt to any situation and society, and found content as a malcontent. \n\nHoward found himself trapped in a world that he never made when the power-hungry demon [[Thog]] the Nether-Spawn used his magic to shift the interdimensional Cosmic Axis in hopes that all realities could be collapsed into one under his control. Howard was plucked from Duckworld and dropped into the middle of the Florida Everglades on Earth-- the site of this world's [[Nexus of All Realities]]. Reluctantly, Howard joined the similarly-dislodged [[Korrek the Barbarian]] and Earth’s [[Kale, Jennifer|Jennifer Kale]], [[Dakimh the Enchanter]], and the [[Man-Thing]] in stopping the forces of Thog. When the battle was over, Howard accidentally fell off the otherdimensional Stepping Stones of Oblivion and landed in the city of Cleveland, Ohio. \n\nIn Cleveland, Howard was almost immediately arrested for believing to be disrupting the peace. (Actually, the culprit was [[Garko the Man-Frog]] who had stumbled into an encounter with Howard.) However, the police soon released him, not wanting to face the public ridicule for having booked a duck. Howard then hoped to find a job, perhaps by solving a series of murders, and instead found himself in an encounter with the vampiric [[Hellcow]]. \n\nDespondent that he might never get home or even a job, Howard happened upon the castle of the costumed criminal accountant [[Pro-Rata]]. He rescued young life model [[Switzler, Beverly|Beverly Switzler]], escaping with the timely arrival of [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]. Bev invited Howard to stay with her, and the two even fell in love. \n\nAlthough Howard has attempted to live as normal a life as possible, considering that he is a talking duck on a world of human beings, he has continually run afoul (so to speak) of various unusual menaces, most notably the members of the [[Band of the Bland]] and his archnemesis [[Doctor Bong]]. However, through cleverness, persistence, and (perhaps most of all) good luck, Howard has always managed to defeat or escape his adversaries. \n\nHoward came to public notoriety when he became a candidate for the United States presidency on a very minor party ticket known as the All-Night Party. However, the general populace refused to believe that Howard is a real talking duck, thinking of him instead as a small person in a duck suit, and the public dismissed his candidacy as a joke.\n\nBev eventually asked that she and Howard separate. Howard, despite his feelings for her, agreed but embarked on a series of wanderings that took him around the country, from Chicago, to New York, and San Francisco. His adventures finally led him back to Cleveland, whereupon he and Bev reunited. After the two reunited Howard faced several different and strange foes such as [[Ducktor Doom (Larval Earth)]], [[Spider-Ham (Larval Earth)]], [[Captain Americana]], [[Jackpot]], [[Grey Panther]], [[Kidney Lady]], [[Mister Chicken]], [[Pinball Lizard]], and several other creatures and people with fantastic (and sometimes lame) powers.\n\nWhen Howard’s nemesis [[Doctor Angst (Floyd Mangles)|Doctor Angst]] attempted to “squish” all realities into a universal state of inertness, Howard was chosen by the cosmic entity called the Critic to join [[She-Hulk]] in confronting Doctor Angst and the Band of the Bland, and the universes were restored to their rightful order.\n\n[[Image:Howard.jpeg|left]]\nLater, Howard encountered the young mutants [[Chamber]] and [[Skin]], who were on the run of the mutant-hunting [[X-Cutioner]]. Howard helped them escape and make their way back to their team, [[Generation X]], at the Massachusetts Academy. Howard stayed at the Academy briefly, forming a friendship with the children [[Artie Maddicks|Artie]], [[Leech]], and [[Richards, Franklin|Franklin Richards]]. About the same time, the Academy was targeted by the villain [[Cassidy, Black Tom|Black Tom]], and Man-Thing rescued the children, Howard, and an alien refugee [[Nile, Tana|Tana Nile]]. This unlikely band of heroes helped Man-Thing restore balance to the Nexus of All Realities before being returned to the Academy and Howard soon parted company.\n\nWhen a group of heroes was restored to reality after being shunted to Franklin Richards' [[Counter-Earth (Franklin Richards)|Counter Earth]], the Nexus of Reality was damaged. Howard, because of his experiences passing through the Nexus, he found that a fragment of it became lodged within him. The [[Cult of Entropy]], led by [[Mahapralaya]], hoped to kill Howard in the Man-Thing's swamp and thus destroy the Nexus, Howard was rescued by the Man-Thing and [[Brandt, Ellen|Ellen Brandt]]. The Man-Thing merged with the Nexus fragment by pouring itself down Howard's throat and being regurgitated. Mahapralaya and the cultists were forced to flee, and Howard left for Cleveland.\n\nMore recently, Bev found a new job at a dot com company, only to find it was run by, [[Doctor Bong]] and was captured. Howard rescued Bev, and in the process he was thrown into a vat of chemicals that transformed him into a humanoid rat. While seeking his revenge, Dr Bong destroyed Howard and Bev’s house. They found refuge in the Boarding House of Mystery. However, they were still pursued by Dr. Bong. Finally, by using the magical [[Amulet of Pazuzu]], Howard was able to defeat Dr. Bong. Afterwards, he was asked to go on the Iprah talk show, but Iprah was possessed by the [[Demons|demon]]-[[Angels|angel]] hybrid [[Deuteronomy]]. Howard destroyed Deuteronomy by using the cigar from the Saint of Therapists, but a puff on that same cigar instantly disintegrated Howard. Now frees from his duck body Howard’s soul passed into the afterlife, and Howard had a conversation with God about the meaning of life. Not long after that conversation God allowed Howard to return to the body of a duck and return to Earth. He was seen recently at the trial of [[She-Hulk]], where he vouched for her not to be erased from history.",

            "bio": "Average technician George Tarleton found his fate forever changed thanks to a random selection by his boss, the Scientist Supreme of [[A.I.M.]], who needed a unique, bio-engineered “living computer” in order to plumb the mysteries of the [[Cosmic Cube]]. Tarleton was subjected to hideous experiments, mutating his body into a massive-headed being possessing superhuman intelligence and extraordinary psionic powers, and the process drove him mad. Given the code-name MODOC (\"Mobile Organism Designed Only for Computing\"), Tarleton instead turned on his superiors, slaying them all and declaring himself Scientist Supreme. Moreover, he changed his name to MODOK, with the “K” standing now for “Killing.” \n\nKnowing only the barest of information, S.H.I.E.L.D. sent its [[Carter, Sharon|Agent 13]] to gather intelligence about A.I.M. and MODOK, but she was captured and [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] was then sent to the rescue. The two heroes were captured, but ultimately discovered MODOK when he revealed himself and tried to kill them personally. During the resultant clash, other A.I.M. agents, those opposed to MODOK's leadership, turned on him and allowed Captain America and Agent 13 to escape. The submarine base destroyed, MODOK was believed dead, although he used his psionic abilities to save himself and soon reasserted his leadership over A.I.M.\n\nInitially, MODOK turned A.I.M.’s pursuits toward acquiring technology and new recruits, running into conflict with Captain America, [[Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)|Doctor Doom]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]], and the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]]. During the latter confrontation, MODOK first used a giant robot body in a preemptive strike on the Hulk, and later he mutated [[Ross-Banner, Betty|Betty Ross]] into the Harpy to defeat him (although MODOK was stopped by the arrival of the [[Bird People]].) MODOK used his giant body to confront [[Iron Man (Anthony Stark)|Iron Man]], capturing him but being defeated by the [[Yellow Claw]]. \n\nFollowing this defeat, MODOK was deposed as leader of A.I.M., as his followers were dissatisfied with MODOK's increasing preoccupation with his super-powered adversaries causing A.I.M. to largely abandon its goals for scientific breakthroughs. However, MODOK regained control of a West Coast faction of A.I.M. and, in alliance with [[Deathbird]], he led A.I.M. in an attack on its East Coast division. Still, a considerable portion of the A.I.M. organization remained outside of MODOK's control. MODOK did not realize that the members of A.I.M. whom he believed were securely under his control were secretly conspiring with the other faction of A.I.M. to destroy him. To his surprise, both A.I.M. groups joined forces and attacked him. MODOK retreated, soon afterwards fighting A.I.M. forces alongside the Hulk, but he finally fled after battling the Hulk himself. With MODOK gone, all of A.I.M. was finally reunited under new leadership. \n\nThe new leaders of A.I.M. hired the [[Serpent Society]] to assassinate MODOK to prevent him from posing any further threat to them. MODOK had escaped capture, ultimately hiding in a warehouse at a shopping mall in Newbury, New Jersey, but he was followed by both the Serpent Society and Captain America. Captain America found the weakened MODOK as two of the Serpents, [[Cottonmouth]] and [[Death Adder]], were tearing away at his flesh. MODOK died even as Captain America was trying to help him, and the Serpents delivered his corpse back to A.I.M. \n\nA.I.M. managed to keep MODOK’s body for use as a living computer, similar to his intended origin, but A.I.M. agent Yorgon Tykkio sent MODOK into battle against Iron Man, guiding him by remote control. At the height of battle, however, Tykkio caused MODOK's headband to fire plasma that ignited underground fuel lines, causing an explosion that ultimately annihilated MODOK's body. \n\nYears later, A.I.M. once again sought the control of the Cosmic Cube, and in so doing they tore reality itself. Using the Cube, they restored MODOK to life, hoping that he could command the energies to fix reality. Although it was actually an Adaptoid that saved the day, MODOK took advantage to resume leadership of A.I.M. once more. \n\nHe returned to his preoccupation with his rivals, battling Captain America and Iron Man, but he also explored new avenues for A.I.M., such as exploring the relationship of science and magic (running afoul of [[Alpha Flight]] for reviving their member [[Snowbird]]), allying with [[Hydra]] over nanotechnology (before taken down by [[Citizen V (John Watkins III)|Citizen V]] and the [[V-Battalion]]), and creating a legitimate corporate front for A.I.M. as Advanced Corp. (until exposed by Iron Man.)  MODOK was once saved by the [[Headmen]] from where he had lost himself in an extradimensional quest for additional power. In gratitude, he agreed to join them in their hopes of taking over the world, helping them do so with the help of the alien [[Orrgo]]. MODOK admitted, however, that this association was merely scientific, as he examined the efforts of the Headmen to better understand himself, and he and A.I.M. disassociated themselves from the Headmen before the villains were thwarted by the Defenders. \n\nIn a strange series of events, MODOK appeared to be hunting down and killing all A.I.M. agents responsible for his original transformation. In fact, MODOK had switched bodies with [[Rivas, Damocles|Damocles “the Saint” Rivas]], the brother of a drug lord who developed a viral bio-weapon using MODOK’s DNA, and Damocles was acting on MODOK’s long-suppressed hatred of his form. MODOK had hoped to use Rivas to claim the scheme for himself, but ran afoul of the [[Falcon (Sam Wilson)|Falcon]] and the [[Anti-Cap]]. His defeat sent his mind back into his body, where it co-existed with Damocles. Damocles instead hoped to engage the Hulk in battle and thereby destroy MODOK’s form, but Captain America intervened, inspiring Damocles to use MODOK’s mental powers to revert the Hulk to Bruce Banner and gain his help to cure the MODOK virus. MODOK was rendered comatose, but he soon reverted to normal to once more lead A.I.M., with all traces of Damocles Rivas expunged.",

            "bio": "[[image:Star-Lord-Quill.jpg|left]]Wrongly branded a traitor by his father [[Eson of Spartoi|Eson]], Prince [[Jason of Spartoi]] fled the Empire, exploring deep space for many years. When war broke out between the [[Spartoi|Spartoi Empire]] and the [[Ariguan|Ariguan Confederacy]], Eson summoned his wayward son home, but en route his ship's converter blew. To avoid a complete meltdown, and with his ship apparently slipping backwards through time, Jason crash landed in Earth's Colorado Mountains, his arrival witnessed by [[Quill, Meredith|Meredith Quill]], who dragged him from the burning vessel. As she nursed him back to health and helped him rebuild his ship, the pair fell in love. After a year, Jason was ready to depart; informed by his bio-comps that Meredith had just conceived their child and unwilling to endanger her, Jason reluctantly left Meredith behind, promising to return for her once the war ended, but mindlocking her memories, sparing her the heartbreak he felt. Less than a month later, Meredith married her childhood sweetheart, Jake. \n\nSuspecting Meredith's child was not his, when Peter Jason Quill was born, Jake angrily noted that the infant resembled neither of them. Intending to slay the child, Jake carried him outside, but suffered a fatal heart attack; Peter was left staring into the starlit sky for an hour before Meredith found strength to crawl outside to him. Mentally and physically weakened, Meredith's world revolved around raising her son. Peter grew up a loner, fascinated by science fiction shows and [[NASA]]'s exploits. \n\nWhen the Spartoi / Ariguan conflict turned in Sparta's favor, Jason asked his uncle [[Gareth of Spartoi|Gareth]] to bring his family to him. Having his own designs on the throne, Gareth instead hired [[Shakati, Kyras|Kyras Shakati]], crimelord of Cinnibar, to eliminate the Quills; Shakati in turn sent the Ariguan Sith-Lord [[Rruothk'ar]] to carry out the murder. Peter, now 11, witnessed Rruothk'ar's ship land, and watched Rruothk'ar and his men slay his mother. The killers departed, unaware they had missed their main target; Peter swore to one day make them pay. Gareth informed Jason that his wife and son had died in childbirth, while Peter became increasingly insular, running away from the orphanage on his 13th birthday. Subsequently devoting himself to intense study, he graduated college and was accepted into NASA's space effort astronaut training program. Though one of their highest ever scoring trainees, he remained socially withdrawn, his sole friend his pet owl, Al. During training, Peter risked his life to save fellow student [[Harrelson, Greg|Greg Harrelson]] when a centrifuge malfunctioned, but afterwards castigated Harrelson for being too stupid to save himself, engendering a deep hatred. When Peter's lack of social skills saw him passed over for Mars Probe III in favor of Harrelson, Peter re-evaluated his life. He spent the next five months improving his deportment, eventually being assigned to Eve, NASA's first permanently manned space station; entering space for the first time was a rapturous experience for Quill.\n\nThough Peter loved being amongst the stars, he soon realized his childhood vow might never be fulfilled, as mankind's limited technology meant he was unlikely to venture further into space. A couple of months later, Eve's crew witnessed a celestial apparition which declared itself Star-Lord, a concept of what a Terran of their selection would become in a fortnight. Peter volunteered, but Houston High Command was skeptical of the vision's claims, and felt that any candidate required more space experience; Peter's violent reaction saw him discharged Earth-side. Refusing to miss his opportunity, Peter stole a scoutship from Cape Canaveral, returned to Eve, and shot his way to the appointed spot, where his old rival Harrelson, NASA's choice, was awaiting selection. Dislodging his rival at the critical moment, Peter was transported away in his stead. Finding himself before the enigmatic [[Master of the Sun]], Peter admitted his transgressions, but was nonetheless transformed into Star-Lord; to free Peter of his need for vengeance, the Master seemingly allowed Peter to destroy an Ariguan ship, afterwards informing him he was free to begin a new life and giving him [[Ship (Aurora)|Ship]], a sentient former star who would be his guide and companion.\n\n[[image:Star-Lord-in1.jpg|left|thumb]]Perhaps knowing Peter needed closure, Ship seemingly took Star-Lord into his father's future time, where he learned of slavers destroying whole planets and kidnapping the surviving populace; catching up with them just after they had devastated [[Windhölme]], his attack inspired a slave revolt. Accompanied by the revolt's leaders, [[Hölm, Kip|Kip Hölm]] and [[Sandy]], Peter used Kip's psychic powers to track the slavers back to their Cinnibar base and slavelord Kyras Shakati. Sandy slew him and the trio fled moments before a dead man's switch destroyed Shakati's palace, but not before Star-Lord scanned his computers, learning that the slaving financed a planned coup. Racing to Sparta to prevent this, they confronted Gareth and Rruothk'ar; Star-Lord recognized Rruothk'ar as his mother's killer and slew him, then crossed swords with Gareth. A superior duelist, Gareth disarmed and unmasked Star-Lord; startled by his resemblance to Jason, his shock allowed Star-Lord to turn the tables, and he slew Gareth moments before the Emperor arrived. Recognizing his son, Jason informed Peter of his origins, overjoyed to have found him again, but Peter rejected the notion of becoming the Empire's heir, suggesting Jason adopt Kip instead. Years later, Jason tried again to convince his son to return to Sparta, but was again rebuffed.\n\nAmbushed above the planet Ferrol by a [[Lorq]] starfighter squadron, Ship was shot down. To operate on the badly injured Star-Lord, Ship generated a human form; amused that Peter didn't recognize her when he revived, Ship pretended to be explorer Caryth Halyan. Witnessing Lorq ships searching overhead, the pair located a crystal cavern housing the Lorq's prey: the gestating [[Trinity-Which-Is-One]], a telepathic entity linked in a symbiotic lifecycle with the indigenous [[Dune Devils]]. Caryth and Ship died defending Peter and the Trinity when the Lorq attacked them, with Caryth dying in Star-Lord's arms after he downed the Lorq vessels; however, Ship's energy state was indestructible, and the maturing Trinity healed Ship's disrupted consciousness, allowing her to resume spaceship form.\n\nWhen Ship sensed the destruction of the planet Carillon by the [[Haalmhad]] homeship, the same people who had destroyed Ship's planets back when she was a star, Star-Lord rushed to the K'yndar system to save its other inhabited world, [[Cymoril]]; while Ship distracted the Haalmhad, Star-Lord disabled their homeship, then stranded the inhabitants on a primitive world 20 parsecs away. Investigating an unidentified massive power source on planet [[Redstone]], Star-Lord learned the world's \"founder\" [[Quan-Zarr]] had slaughtered the previous inhabitants, experimenting on the survivors to turn their children into leonine [[Beastmen]], who now sought revenge. Star-Lord allowed the Beastmen to attack Quan-Zarr's tower and slay the scientist, but was forced to kill the last surviving Beastman before he used Quan-Zarr's [[Power-Rod]] to destroy the entire colony. Snatched from Ship by an artificial fusion vortex, Star-Lord was then taken onboard a space ark. [[Ark]] leader [[Noah]] claimed they were the time-lost last survivors of Earth, but another inhabitant, [[Aletha]], revealed that they were aliens cloaked by illusions, whose militaristic rulers planned to conquer Earth using information extracted from him. With Star-Lord's aid, the ark's populace overthrew Noah, and, reunited with Ship, Star-Lord departed once more. \n\nWhen an Ariguan assault force attacked the Master of the Sun, Star-Lord came to his aid, only for the Master to claim he too was an Ariguan, the scientist Ragnar, who had defied his people by creating the Star-Lord and must now face their justice; reluctantly, Peter acquiesced. On the cloud-shrouded planet [[Heaven]], a world ruled by a strict honor code, Star-Lord rescued [[Thorn (unrevealed)|Thorn]] from a fatal fall, then protected him from the huntress Shreen until Thorn's wings regrew, only to watch them both sacrifice themselves for honor's sake. Investigating ruins on the primordial planet [[Symbion]], Star-Lord mistook the sentient planet's attempts to communicate as attacks and he fled, leaving the lonely worldmind to mourn his departure.\n\n[[image:Star-Lord-Quill-cyborg.jpg|left|thumb|Star-Lord with cybernetic enhancements]]Star-Lord returned to Sparta for his father's 100th coronation jubilee, regretting he had never taken the opportunity to know him. Jason intended to abdicate in favor of Kip, and willingly departed with his son to explore the universe; however, an unspecified period of time later, Star-Lord was separated from Ship when she was caught in a black hole's gravity; Jason's fate is unrecorded. Perhaps because of injuries sustained escaping the hole, Star-Lord received numerous cybernetic implants. Confronted with the threat of the [[Fallen One (unrevealed)|Fallen One]], [[Galactus]]' first herald, Star-Lord subdued his much stronger opponent but 350,000 lives were sacrificed to provide the energy needed. Guilt-stricken, he abandoned his Star-Lord identity and accepted imprisonment on the [[Kyln]] interstellar prison. There Peter allied with fellow inmates including [[Ch'ak]], [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Dar, Moloka|Moloka Dar]] and [[Thanos]] to oppose the cosmic-powered [[Maker]]. Afterwards, Gladiator remanded Peter into his custody, drafting him into the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard]]. Quill recently left the Guard, signing up with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]'s (Richard Rider) anti-Annihilation Wave forces shortly after the Tartus Minor incident, and now serves as Rider's main aide and advisor.",

            "bio": "A former saxophonist, Arthur Sampson \"Art\" Douglas and his family were killed by the Titanian Eternal [[Thanos]] while driving across the Mojave Desert. Kronos recovered Douglas' astral form and used it to create a superhuman warrior for the purpose of defeating Thanos. After Thanos was defeated, Drax was eventually killed by a psychic attack from [[Moondragon]].\n\nYears later, Drax was resurrected to once again battle Thanos (also recently resurrected). Drax's resurrection was not perfect, however; his brain remained damaged from his previous death. After Thanos was defeated a second time, Drax became a member of the [[Infinity Watch]] and guardian of the Power Gem.\n\n[[Warlock, Adam|Adam Warlock]], leader of the Watch, shut off Drax's hunger to kill Thanos when he had the Infinity Gauntlet. However Moondragon accidentally caused some of his memories to resurface, and returned to him his insane hunger to kill Thanos.\n\nDrax partially regained his intelligence when he and his daughter Moondragon petitioned Kronos, the being who had resurrected Arthur Douglas as Drax, to restore his mind and heal the severe injuries Moondragon had suffered. Moondragon gave up some of her mental prowess and Drax gave up some of his bulk to heal one another. The recovery took time, and Drax was for a while still dim-witted (but nowhere near as badly as he was before), undergoing tutoring by his daughter. Drax was taken to the [[Microverse]] where he was mistaken for the [[Hulk (Bruce Banner)|Hulk]] and helped the [[Microns]] overthrow the [[Psycho-Man]] and [[Fredd]], an evil clone of [[Photon (Genis-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]. Drax decided to remain there and help the Microns rebuild the Microverse's government.\n\nDrax battled the [[Fallen One (Tryco Slatterus)|Champion]] for control of a planet that Champion had taken over. Drax lost the battle, but the Champion was later defeated by [[She-Hulk]].\n\nRecently, as a detainee aboard a galactic prison transport, Drax crashed on Earth and escaped imprisonment, along with the other inmates. He regained his intelligence and fought the other inmates when they threatened the local townsfolk and the 10 year old girl named [[Cammi]], who befriended him. Drax and Cammi were then taken to an intergalactic prison known as the [[Kyln]]\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time the being known as [[Annihilus]] attacked Kyln. Having survived, Drax and Cammi team-up with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]. During their time together Drax teaches Nova how to better harness the [[Nova Force]] and how to kill. Eventually Drax and Cammi join Nova's [[United Front]] and oppose Annihilus. During a crucial battle Drax is once more confronted by Thanos, who is trying to save [[Galactus]]. However, before Thanos could free Galactus, Drax managed to punch a hole through the Mad Titan's chest, killing him. Realizing his mistake he uses the power of the [[Silver Surfer]] to save Galactus. Once freed Galactus teleported both Drax and Moondragon to an undisclosed location. From there Drax vanished.\n\nSometime after the war with Annihilus, the [[Phalanx (species)|Phalanx]] managed to take over [[Kree]] Space and infect many worlds. Now trapped within Kree Space, Drax was hunted by a Phalanx infected Nova and [[Gamora]]. During the chase Nova was able to capture Drax and he was then infected with the techno-organic virus, becoming a Phalanx Select. Now working for the Phalanx he was recently given the assignment to hunt down and capture or kill Nova, who escaped from the Phalanx's grasp. Following Nova into a wormhole, Nova, Gamora, and Drax are now stranded in an unknown quadrant of space.\n\nAfter the events of the Annihilation Conquest, Drax agreed to join a group of cosmic heroes to form a proactive line of defense against potential treats to the Universe. The group was led by [[Jason of Spartoi]]’s son Peter Quill, also known as the [[Star-Lord (Peter Quill) |Star-Lord]]. After many failed attempts of coming up with a name, [[Rocket Raccoon]] suggested that they take the name of [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. The team used [[Knowhere]] as their base of operation. Knowhere is located inside the decapitated head of an unidentified [[Celestials|Celestial]] that was floating on the very edge of the universe. \n\nWhile on Knowhere, Drax would come into conflict with the [[Luminals]] who were the protectors of this peaceful place. Drax and the Guardians first mission pitted them against the [[Universal Church of Truth]] which was a group of very powerful religious fanatics. Later during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull infiltration]] that destroyed the Continuum Cortex, [[Cynosure (female)|Cynosure]] sent her team after the missing Drax, when it was suspected he could be a [[Skrull]]. Three of her finest, [[Massdriver]], [[Impact]] and [[Brightstorm]], were left defeated and in intensive care following a furious battle with the Destroyer. When questioned about his mysterious disappearances by [[Quasar (Phyla-Vell)|Quasar]], Drax revealed that he had been using the Continuum Cortex to search for Cammi.",

            "bio": "One of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, MacGargan has recently abandoned his Scorpion suit and identity bonding with the alien symbiote that had previously been hosted by Peter Parker and Eddie Brock. He now goes by the infamous name, Venom.\n \n==SCORPION==\n\nFormer private investigator Mac Gargan was hired by [[Jameson, J. Jonah|J. Jonah Jameson]] to find out how Peter Parker is able to get incredible pictures of [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]. Gargan's efforts to locate Peter in order to find out the truth triggered Parkers's spider sense, making him easily avoidable. \n\nFrustrated, Jameson decided to pay $10,000 to Gargan as the subject of an experiment.  An experiment created by [[Stillwell, Farley|Dr. Farley Stillwell]], a researcher in animal mutation which endowed the subject with the characteristic of another animal. Unfortunately the process resulted in the loss of Gargan's sanity, and the creation of the super-powered criminal menace known as the Scorpion.\n\nOver the years Scorpion fought and was bested by Spider-Man many times. Most of these confrontations were the result of Spider-Man stepping in on an attempt on the life of Jameson, who Gargan hated even more than Spider-Man. With his mechanical tail, speed, and strength, Scorpion has always been more than a match for Spider-Man. Only the skill, experience, and quick wit of the web head helped him defeat Gargan.\n\nLater on, Scorpion was recruited by [[Green Goblin (Norman Osborn)|Norman Osborn]], informed of Spider-man's real identity, and ordered to kidnap Peter's [[Parker, May (Aunt May)|Aunt May]] if anything should happen to Osborn. In the middle of his task Scorpion was approached by the recently freed symbiote. Risking Osborn's wrath, Gargan chose the symbiote over Osborn's mission, since the symbiote's potential for power was far greater than any newly designed Scorpion suit could ever be. Thus transforming Scorpion into the even more monstrous Venom.\n\n==VENOM==\n\nDying of cancer, [[Brock, Eddie|Eddie Brock]] decided to auction for charity to the highest bidder the alien symbiote from which he derives his powers as Venom.\n\nAfter being purchased by New York mobster [[Fortunato, Don|Don Fortunato]] to be used by his son [[Fortunato, Angelo|Angelo]], thinking him weak, the alien symbiote abandoned its new host leaving him to fall to his death after a short and murderous career.\n\nIt then sought out a new host that shared both its hatred of Spider-Man as well as the will and experience of a seasoned criminal. Mac Gargan returned to his apartment after a recent kidnapping of Aunt May and intimidation of Spider-Man, only to find the symbiote which made Gargan a proposition to be its newest host. The one-time Scorpion eagerly accepted the offer, and was thus transformed into the monstrous Venom.\n\nAfter an elaborate plan paid off and the Green Goblin was out of prison, the Goblin led Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat]] into a direct confrontation with the newly formed [[Sinister Twelve]], which included the new, more powerful Venom among its ranks.\n\nVenom and the Twelve very nearly defeated Spider-Man before the [[Fantastic Four]] and a small faction of the [[Avengers]] headed by [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] joined in, leading to the eventual defeat of the Twelve.\n\nIn the midst of the battle Osborn escaped, with the full intention to murder Peter's wife, [[Watson-Parker, Mary Jane|Mary Jane]]. Spider-Man soon followed only to be stopped by Venom. The two foes continued to battle high above on New York's rooftops. After catching Gargan off balance Spider-Man dropped a condemned building on the new Venom, ending the battle. Venom was arrested and sent to [[Ryker's Island|Ryker]]'s. He promised Spider-Man he would never reveal his identity, as that was his only leverage against him.\n\nMore recently, Gargan has escaped prison. He journeyed to [[Battleworld]], along with a ragtag group of characters including the likes of [[Yellowjacket (Henry Pym)|Henry Pym]], [[Gravity]], the [[Hood]], and others, in order to enter a contest arranged by the [[Stranger]] posing as the [[Maker|Beyonder]]. Shortly thereafter, Venom was approached by a joint [[Commission on Superhuman Activities|CSA]] / [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] task force, and joined the new [[Thunderbolts]] team which was formed during the [[Civil War]] to stop unregistered heroes.\n\nFollowing his stint with the Thunderbolts, Venom was given the opportunity to pose as his hated enemy, Spider-Man, for Norman Osborn's Avengers. As the wall-crawler, Venom had been given the run of the town, disguising his insanity by bringing others to justice and being declared the hero. One such individual saw through Venom's facade and wanted to rehabilitate the evil within him. The [[Redeemer]] gathered together a [[Redeemer's Gang|group of others]] who had come into contact with Venom - leaving them horribly disfigured - and they tried to confront the madman. Venom made quick work of the Redeemer and his gang, leaving some dead and the rest incarcerated. During that time, Osborn had even sent [[Bullseye]] and [[Daken]] to eliminate Venom for becoming more trouble than he was worth. When they failed, Venom resumed his spot on the Avengers - knowing the next time he was deemed expendable, he would deal with Osborn himself.",

He was caught and sentenced to 5 years in jail, but got out early for good behavior. Once freed he began to work at Stark International's design department.\nWhen his daughter was diagnosed with a fatal heart condition, Lang sought help from Dr. Erica Sondheim, who was kidnapped by Cross Technological Enterprises founder Darren Cross, for help with his own heart condition. In order to rescue her, and save his daughter, Lang broke in to the home of [[Yellowjacket (Henry Pym)|Dr. Henry Pym]], the first Ant-Man, and stole his technology. After a successful rescue, Lang tried to turn himself in, but Pym allowed him to keep the suit, but for the purpose of good.\n\nDividing his time between costumed heroics and his family responsibilities, Ant-Man worked alongside several super heroes, aiding members of the [[Avengers]] against the mercenary [[Taskmaster]] on two occasions. When [[Baron Zemo (Helmut)|Baron Zemo]]’s [[Masters of Evil]] attacked the Avengers and took control of the [[Avengers Mansion]], Ant-Man offered his assistance to the Avengers in defeating the criminal super-team. The [[Fantastic Four]] subsequently hired him as an electronics expert when [[Mister Fantastic]] was believed to be dead, and he was inducted into the team.\n\nFollowing Mister Fantastic’s return, Ant-Man joined the team known as [[Heroes for Hire]] and clashed with such enemies as [[Ghaur]] and the Master. After Heroes For Hire disbanded, he again aided the Avengers against the Taskmaster; he also began dating former super hero [[Jones, Jessica|Jessica Jones]], although their relationship ended after he learned she was pregnant with [[Cage, Luke|Luke Cage]]’s child. Ant-Man next fought alongside the Avengers against the menace of [[Scorpio]] and the [[In-Betweener]], then was invited to join full-time, a role he only accepted after losing custody of his daughter to his ex-wife.\n\nAs an Avenger, Ant-Man had always butted heads with his dog because he was a yellow lab, [[Jack of Hearts]], who later sacrificed his life in order to rescue Ant-Man's daughter. Ant-Man was killed when Jack of Heart's resurrected body blew up the Avenger's Mansion.",
